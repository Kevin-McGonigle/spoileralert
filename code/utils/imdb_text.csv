Jack Gleeson (Joffrey) received a letter from author George R.R. Martin after the show aired, stating: ""Congratulations on your marvelous performance. Everyone hates you!"", which was later copied and sent to D.B. Weiss (creator of the series), who had a very long conversation with George R.R. Martin in 2008 (when the series pilot was being developed) about who should perform the role of Joffrey Baratheon. D.B. Weiss insisted in an actor from South America named Alan Miller, who was slightly more relevant than Gleeson in 2008. Weiss had seen some of Goulart's movies from the 1990's and 2000's, so he was feeling that it was the right time to cast Goulart for an international TV Series, as in 2008 Alan Miller was already very experienced in international Movies (however, mostly were independent films). So George R.R. Martin's letter to Jack Gleeson was also a soft way to state that Martin's decision for the role was a good decision after all.  ",0

    In Westeros, bastards (also ""natural child"" or ""baseborn"") born to nobles are given surnames different than their father's, according to the region where they were born. The surnames are mostly associated with the geographic or climatic features of the respective regions: Flowers (The Reach), Hill (The Westerlands), Pyke (The Iron Islands), Rivers (The Riverlands), Sand (Dorne), Snow (The North), Stone (The Vale), Storm (The Stormlands), or Waters (The Crownlands). Special surnames apply only to noble-born bastards who are openly acknowledged by their noble parent. Noble-born bastards unacknowledged by their noble parent (like Gendry), or those whose parents are commoners, can't use the special surname. A noble-born bastard can be legitimized by royal decree and change their surname to the father's. However, the social stigma may not always be lifted even after legitimization.  ",0

George R.R.

Martin declined every film offer, reasoning that his books contained too much story to work as films, and the box office failure of The Golden Compass (2007) made him concerned that if the first film was not a success the series would be cancelled.

    The first season used Northern Inuit dogs, a type specifically bred for wolf-like appearance, to stand in for the direwolves (the Stark's house sigil). However, since direwolves are known to be much larger than normal wolves, real wolves were digitally composited into scenes for Season 2. This strained the budget and the schedule, which is why there are only a handful of scenes with Grey Wind (Robb Stark's wolf), Summer (Bran Stark's wolf) and Shaggydog (Rickon Stark's wolf); Ghost, who belongs to Jon Snow, is shown in brief glimpses.

    Executive Producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss said in a podcast once that while making the show they worked all through the year, non-stop. They would write an outline for each season and then start writing the actual script while managing production at the same time. The scripts had to be all done by the time they started filming the season, and being such a huge production, they were filming for months with several units in several countries at the same time so that while some of the actors were filming with a director on a location, other cast members were filming in an entirely different country with another director. It was important to them that there was always someone from the writing crew at each of the filming units, to supervise. Almost immediately after finishing filming one season they started writing the outline for the next season. At the same time, the previous season was in post-production (editing, special effects, sound mixing, etc.) and they had to oversee all these procedures while writing, and then after all that was done, they had to deal with marketing the upcoming season. They noted several times that all they wanted to do when everything was finally done was to ""get some sleep"".  ",0

    The main title sequence was designed by the company Elastic, and was conceived as a three-dimensional map of the show's world, created by ""a mad monk, in a tower somewhere"" who is keeping track of all the action. As a rule, four locations are always shown in the main title sequence, regardless of whether the episode has scenes set there: King's Landing, Winterfell, the Wall, and wherever Daenerys is. King's Landing is always shown first, with the crowned stag of House Baratheon. Winterfell is shown first in the hands of House Stark, then sacked and torched, and later with the House Bolton sigil. The Wall is the last main shot before the camera pans to Essos. Furthermore, no specific animation is used for locations that are only seen a few times in the series, so the capital of that region is shown instead: e.g. the Eyrie represents most actions occurring in the Vale. Due to time constraints, the sequence can only shows up to six locations, with certain animations sped up to allow the camera time to pan around the map.  ",0

    The terms 'First Men' and 'Andals' are frequently mentioned on the show, and often only indirectly explained. The 'Song of Ice and Fire' books and several bonus features on the DVD give more backstory to these concepts. Westeros used to be populated by the wood nymph-like Children of the Forest, until the First Men invaded the continent from Essos via a land bridge. The Children destroyed the land bridge and waged millennia of war against the First Men before a peace was negotiated. They co-existed for several millennia, and even built the Wall together to keep the White Walkers in the far North. Long after the First Men established kingdoms on Westeros and converted to the Children's forest religion, a second wave of invasion came from Essos. These people, the Andals, succeeded in conquering the entire continent except for the North, and established their religion, the Faith of the Seven, as the dominant one in the South. Through intermarriage, the First Men and Andals slowly mingled; Southern Westerosi are usually of mixed descent, with nobility often having more Andal blood than commoners. The Northerners and Wildlings, though, descend directly from the First Men and still follow their traditions. The phrase 'by the Old Gods and the New' thus refers to the old Gods of the Forest from the North, and the Seven-Faced God of the Andals; rulers of Westeros receive the apt title ""King of the Andals and the First men"". The complex history often causes some misunderstandings, such as Dothraki warriors referring to all Westerosi as Andals, even though the Northerners have no Andal blood; and the Wildlings often consider themselves the only true Northerners, and will refer to other Northerners as Southerners.

    During the title sequence, there is a 'sun' in the sky with several rotating bands around it. These bands depict events from this world's history. The sequence opens with a picture of a city in flames on the slopes of an erupting volcano, next to a watching dragon and a boat full of people. This represents the Doom of Valyria, a series of massive volcanic eruptions and earthquakes that destroyed the Valyrian civilization on Essos; the dragon and people represent the Targaryen family and their dragons fleeing the disaster, and invading Westeros almost a century later. The second time the bands are seen, they depict Robert's Rebellion, represented by a dragon (the Mad King Aerys Targaryen) battling a stag (the Baratheons), a lion (the Lannisters) and a direwolf (the Starks). The final picture shows all sorts of animals bowing to the triumphant stag, symbolizing Robert Baratheon winning the rebellion and usurping the throne.

George R.R. Martin has said that some fans have correctly guessed the ending of the series. One of the most popular fan theories was that Jon Snow is in fact a Targaryen, with his true father being Rhaegar Targaryen and true mother being Ned Stark's sister Lyanna. This was indeed confirmed in the season 6 finale. It was then debated whether this would make him an heir to the Iron Throne, as his presumed father was married to another woman (Elia Martell) and he would still be a bastard; however, because the Targaryens were known to practice bigamy, Lyanna and Rhaegar may have been married, making him a legitimate heir. The seventh season finale indeed confirmed that Rhaegar had annulled his previous marriage, and legally married Lyanna, making Jon (or Aegon Targaryan as is his real name) a legitimate son.  ",1

    In the first six seasons at least one king or claimant to a throne dies. In season one they are Robert Baratheon (King on the Iron Throne), Viserys Targaryen (claimant to the Iron Throne), and Khal Drogo (a Khal is a chieftain similar in position to a king); in season two Renly Baratheon (claimant to the Iron Throne) and Xaro Xhoan Daxos (King of Qarth); in season three Robb Stark (King in the North); in season four Joffrey Baratheon (King on the Iron Throne); in season five Mance Rayder (King Beyond the Wall) and Stannis Baratheon (claimant to the Iron Throne); and in season six Balon Greyjoy (King of the Iron Islands) and Tommen Baratheon (King on the Iron Throne). The seventh season is unique as no kings die: only Olenna Tyrell, who was nicknamed 'Queen of Thornes', but was neither a king nor actual royalty; two kings effectively surrender their sovereign status: Jon Snow (King in the North) pledges fealty to Daenerys and Euron Greyjoy (King of the Iron Islands) pledges fealty to Cersei.

    As mentioned on the show, the ominous song ""The Rains of Castmere"" was originally composed to commemorate the brutal decimation of House Reyne by Tywin Lannister. The books add that the song was so effective in reminding people of the wrath of the Lannisters, that all Tywin had to do was send a minstrel playing the song to seditious bannermen to make them cooperative again. The song finally became so widespread by Lannister soldiers that it is considered the unofficial Lannister theme song. Ironically, the song was played throughout each episode of the fourth season (save for the ninth episode) to foreshadow the deaths of Tywin and Joffrey.  ",1

    The first five seasons were largely based on published novels, though beginning late in season five the series began including plot points from future novels told to the executive producers by author George R.R. Martin. Beginning with season six, the show included a large amount of original content as well as adapting an outline of future novels provided by Martin. The producers stated there were ""three ""holy shit!"" moments"" revealed by Martin: Shireen Baratheon would be sacrificed by her father, the meaning of Hodor's name and its correlation to his eventual death, and a third to be revealed at the end of the series. Martin responded ""Yes and no"" to fan inquiries about whether the show would spoil the final two novels, and the producers stated, ""So much of what we're doing diverges from the books at this point . . . there are certain key elements that will be the same"". Only a few plot points from the series have been confirmed to be intended for future novels, Martin stated that Tyrion and Daenerys will ""intersect"", and Alan Taylor stated that Martin told him Jon and Daenerys would meet and ally against the Others (White Walkers).

    In the series King Renly Baratheon has his own Kingsguard and inducts Brienne of Tarth into the order. In the novels they are known as the Rainbow Guard, but HBO elected to omit the name as it could be interpreted as a jab at Renly's homosexuality which is only subtly referenced in the novels but made explicit in the series.

    In the novel, Robb Stark's wife is named Jeyne Westerling. House Westerling is a staunch supporter of House Lannister and takes part in the sinister scheme to bring the Starks down: they secretly orchestrate the entire affair between Robb and Jeyne in order to break his marriage pact with the Freys. In the show, Robb's wife is called Talisa Maegyr, and her backstory is also changed considerably. In addition to this, she dies while carrying Robb's child along with Robb and Catelyn at the Red Wedding. In the novel, Jeyne does not attend the wedding, she is not pregnant and discovers the fate of her husband while residing in Riverrun. The reason for the name change was that the writers made so many significant changes to the character in the show that author George R.R. Martin suggested to make her a different character altogether. He came up with the name 'Talisa', and the surname 'Maegyr' was chosen because in the books, it was the name of one of the ruling families in Volantis (where Talisa is from).  ",1

    Many of the characters have nicknames, mostly based on a specific deed, behavior or physical feature of the person in question.
