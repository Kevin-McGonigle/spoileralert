"At The Twins, Walder Frey presides over the second feast that he has organized in a fortnight. Lord Frey has summoned every Frey who took part in the Red Wedding under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the Arbor but harshly tells his latest wife Kitty Frey that he is not wasting any wine on ""a damn woman"". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the Starks and details the violent deaths of King Robb Stark, his wife Talisa Stark, their unborn child, and Lady Catelyn Stark, much to the nervous laughter of his family.

Arya feigns Walder's identity as she kills his offspring.,1
"However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, ""Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,"" as his family members die around him. ""Walder"" then reveals himself as a disguised Arya Stark, who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the Red Wedding. Arya spares Walder's surviving wives and the servants. She tells them, ""The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.""

Arya meets up with kindly Lannister soldiers.,1
"Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of Lannister soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing ""Hands of Gold"" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to King's Landing. Arya learns from the soldiers that the Great Sept of Baelor and its surroundings have been destroyed and that the Red Keep has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill the Queen. Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.

"Elsewhere, Sandor Clegane is riding north with the Brotherhood Without Banners, through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe. Beric Dondarrion dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the Farmer and his daughter Sally, whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.
",1
"Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at King's Landing, and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what R'hllor, the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a Wall of Ice. He also sees a castle where the Wall meets the sea, a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the dead marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.

Sandor buries Sally and her father.,1
"Later, Thoros finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to the Seven, but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.
",1
Alys Karstark and Ned Umber renew their Houses' vows of fealty to the Starks.,1
"At Winterfell, the King in the North Jon Snow organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for dragonglass, stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When Robett Glover balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter, Lady Lyanna Mormont remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on Bear Island will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.
",1
"The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of Last Hearth and Karhold, the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord Yohn Royce opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but  Sansa Stark interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the Umbers and Karstarks of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons Ned Umber and Alys Karstark - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore. Petyr Baelish watches the proceedings with a smile.
",1
"In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late Joffrey Baratheon did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that he is not Joffrey. Sansa tells Jon that she knows he is nothing like Joffrey and assures Jon that he is good at leadership, but she wants him to be wiser than their late father and brother. She confides that their father sought to protect her from the harshness of reality, including swearing. Maester Wolkan then delivers a message from the newly-crowned Queen Cersei Lannister; though she is apparently not opposed to House Stark reclaiming the North from House Bolton, she demands that they submit to her authority. While Jon is preoccupied with preparing to fight the Night King, Sansa warns him not to underestimate Cersei.

Brienne trains Podrick.,1
"Later, Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne spar with swords. Podrick is struggling and Tormund tells him that he has long to go. Petyr and Sansa are watching Brienne and Podrick sparring. Sansa dismisses Petyr's attempts to get under her skin by stating that she is safe at Winterfell and has Brienne as her sworn shield. She retorts that she only wants peace and quiet when he prods her that she looks unhappy. Brienne, having seen what is going on with Sansa and Petyr, moves over to intervene, and Baelish scurries off. When Brienne asks why Petyr is still at Winterfell, Sansa replies that the Knights of the Vale helped to turn the tide of the Battle of the Bastards. However, Sansa is confident that she knows what Petyr wants.

Meera and Bran approach the Wall.,1
"Beyond the Wall, a column of White Walkers riding undead horses leads a horde of Wights through a snowstorm. Their numbers include at least three undead Giants. Meanwhile, Bran Stark and Meera Reed reach the gate beneath Castle Black. They are greeted by the Acting Lord Commander Eddison Tollett and several armed Black Brothers. Edd asks if they are Wildlings, but Meera introduces herself and Bran. When Edd asks them to verify their identities, Bran responds by ""recognizing"" Edd from the conflicts at the Fist of the First Men and Hardhome, observing that he has seen the army of the dead. Edd decides to bring the two of them inside, glancing nervously at the increasingly hostile lands beyond the Wall.

"At King's Landing, Queen Cersei shows Jaime Lannister a giant map of Westeros she is having painted on a floor. Jaime has not spoken since his return due to his anger with Cersei over the death of their youngest son, the late King Tommen Baratheon. Cersei tells Jaime that their estranged brother Tyrion Lannister has returned with Queen Daenerys Targaryen at the head of an armada. Jaime thinks that Daenerys will land her forces at the fortress of Dragonstone: the Targaryen princess is likely to be drawn to her birthplace, the castle is unoccupied since Stannis Baratheon abandoned it for his doomed campaign in the north,  and more importantly, the deep water around the island will allow her fleet to make anchor. Cersei notes that they have enemies in the south, west, and north: Dorne, the Tyrells and the Starks, respectively.
",1
Cersei and Jaime discuss Tommen's death.,1
"While Cersei has dreams of ushering in a long dynasty, Jaime tells Cersei that they are losing the war, and with all their children dead, not to mention the deaths of Kevan and Lancel in the Great Sept explosion, there is no Lannister line to inherit the Iron Throne. When Jaime asks Cersei about Tommen, she responds angrily that he betrayed them. Cersei adds that they are the only living Lannisters who count. Jaime tells her that they need allies and reports that House Frey has been exterminated. Cersei angrily reminds him that she has been listening to their father's counsel for the past forty years and has learned some things.

"A large Ironborn fleet bearing the sigil of House Greyjoy sails into King's Landing. Cersei tells Jaime that she is planning to forge an alliance with Euron Greyjoy. Jaime criticizes her decision and points out that the Greyjoys are oath breakers and ""bitter killers."" In the throne room, Queen Cersei and Jaime host Euron. Seeking revenge against Yara and Theon Greyjoy for running away with part of the fleet, Euron proposes that they join forces to murder their enemies, including Tyrion.
",1
Cersei and Jaime hold an audience to Euron.,1
"When Jaime questions Euron's legitimacy and trustworthiness, Euron talks about the Greyjoy Rebellion and praises Jaime's swordsmanship, while subtly inferring to Cersei Jaime's loss of a hand makes him inadequate for the wars ahead. Euron adds that he went into exile because of the Greyjoy Rebellion and has returned a feared and experienced pirate captain, and boasts that the Iron Fleet is the greatest fleet that Westeros has ever seen and a military asset that would let the Lannisters reclaim control of the seas. Euron proposes to marry Cersei to seal a marriage pact. Cersei declines due to Euron's history of oath-breaking and his role in murdering his brother Balon Greyjoy. Neither fazed or disappointed, Euron promises that when he returns to King's Landing, he will deliver his ""finest gift"" to Cersei.

Samwell asks for access to the restricted section.,1
"At the Citadel in Oldtown, Samwell Tarly is assigned menial work. His duties include serving the Maesters' meals, emptying their chamber pots, and shelving books. While browsing through the library, he stares at a book behind a locked grate in the restricted section. Later, Samwell helps Archmaester Ebrose to dissect a corpse. Samwell asks the Archmaester if he has read his proposition. In light of what he has seen in the North, Samwell asks for permission to read the restricted section. When Samwell says that he has truly seen the Army of the Dead, the Archmaester responds that Maesters are naturally critical.
",1
"Still, he accepts Samwell's claim because the stories about the Long Night are corroborated in a number of sources. The Archmaester reminds him that Maesters are guardians of knowledge and history. Still, the Archmaester believes that the Wall will not fall because it has stood for millennia. He tells Sam to finish his job. Later that night, Samwell steals a Master's key and enters the forbidden section.

Samwell reads for information on dragonglass.,1
"While Samwell studies, Gilly entertains her young son Sam, who is now a toddler. Gilly asks him about the book he is studying, which is about The Long Night. Samwell mentions that Stannis Baratheon told him that dragonglass could be found on Dragonstone. To his surprise, the book reveals that Stannis was understating the situation: there is a veritable mountain of obsidian just outside the castle. Sam excitedly prepares a letter to Jon Snow relating the discovery.
",1
"The next day, while gathering empty bowls from the cells of the Citadel sanitarium, Samwell is confronted by a shadowy figure whose arm is almost completely covered in greyscale. The figure asks if the Dragon Queen has arrived yet. Samwell sputters that he does not know, and the figure withdraws his arm.

Daenerys comes home.,1
"Meanwhile, Queen Daenerys Targaryen along with her closest advisers  Tyrion Lannister, Varys, Missandei, and Grey Worm  land at Dragonstone island, as all three of her dragons circle overhead. After landing, Daenerys kneels on the ground and touches Westerosi land for the first time since her birth. She and her entourage then climb the steps to Dragonstone castle. Accompanied by Grey Worm and other Unsullied guards, they silently enter the unguarded main gates and deserted courtyard. When they enter the castle itself, Daenerys briefly studies the fiery stag on one of Stannis's banners; after a moment, she rips it down with a firm tug. Daenerys enters the empty throne room and gazes upon the throne of the Targaryens, hewn from volcanic rock. When Grey Worm moves to stand beside her, Missandei holds him back, waiting for their queen. After a moment, Daenerys strides right past the throne and enters the Chamber of the Painted Table. Surveying the discarded markers from Stannis's last use of the Table, Daenerys turns to Tyrion and remarks ""Shall we begin?""

"""Stormborn"" is the second episode of the seventh season of Game of Thrones and the sixty-second episode of the series overall. It premiered on July 23, 2017. It was written by Bryan Cogman and directed by Mark Mylod.[1]
",1
"Daenerys receives an unexpected visitor. Jon faces a revolt. Sam risks his career and life. Tyrion plans the conquest of Westeros.
",1
"During a thunderstorm at Dragonstone, Tyrion Lannister, Varys, and Queen Daenerys Targaryen talk about the stormy circumstances of her birth. Varys informs Daenerys that Queen Cersei Lannister's position on Westeros is tenuous. Tyrion counsels her not to burn the Seven Kingdoms and proposes that she forge alliances with the other houses not currently aligned with Cersei. Dany then questions Varys about his previous services to her father the Mad King and King Robert Baratheon. Varys confides that King Robert Baratheon had little interest in ruling but initially appeared to be a definite improvement over Aerys II.
",1
"Dany then confronts Varys about his role in hiring the assassins to target her; Varys reminds her that his choices were limited to either feigning continuing loyalty to Robert by arranging the assassination, or refusing and losing his head for it. She distrusts Varys due to his track record of switching allegiances. Refusing to be intimidated, Varys points out that incompetent rulers do not deserve blind loyalty, then recounts his lowly origins as a castrated slave and tells her that his true loyalty lies with the oppressed masses. Varys tells Daenerys that if all she wants from him is blind loyalty, she may as well have him killed, but he is much more useful to her and to the Realm alive, and that he believes she is the last hope for the people. Dany accepts his fealty on the condition that he does not conspire against her  rather, she makes him swear to look her in the eye and tell her when she is wrong, as he is doing at this very moment, and Varys does so. Seemingly satisfied, Daenerys also warns Varys that if he betrays her, she will burn him alive. Varys replies that he would expect nothing less from the ""Mother of Dragons.""
",1
"Daenerys is then visited by the Red Priestess Melisandre, who believes that Dany might be The Prince That Was Promised. Varys questions Melisandre about her previous service to the ill-fated King Stannis Baratheon. While Daenerys initially does not believe that she could be the Prince, Missandei reveals that the High Valyrian word for ""prince"" or ""princess"" is gender neutral. When Daenerys asks Melisandre if she believes the prophecy applies to her, Melisandre replies she believes it could refer to Daenerys or one other: Jon Snow, the King in the North, who has united the North and the Wildlings against a common enemy. Tyrion vouches for Jon Snow and convinces Daenerys that he will make a good ally, given the crimes committed by the Lannisters against his family. Dany accepts Tyrion's advice, and tells him to extend an invitation for Jon to attend her at Dragonstone  where Jon must ""bend the knee.""
",1
"In the Chamber of the Painted Table, Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria Sand firmly advocate an immediate assault on King's Landing. Tyrion advises against laying waste to the Kingdoms' capital and causing the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents. When Ellaria belittles Tyrion for his lack of stomach for war (despite his previous command and service at the Battle of the Blackwater), Tyrion retorts by deriding Ellaria in that her sole accomplishment to the war effort has been to poison an innocent girl, his niece Myrcella Baratheon, for the sake of petty vengeance against the Lannisters. Ellaria does not deny it and expresses regret that her lover Oberyn Martell died for the cause of Tyrion's freedom. Daenerys ends the argument with a rebuke for Ellaria to respect her Hand. Back to the matter of the invasion, Daenerys insists she doesn't wish to be known as the Queen of the Ashes, to which Olenna Tyrell sarcastically ponders if Daenerys will take the Iron Throne by asking politely. Olenna reminds Daenerys of her granddaughter Margaery Tyrell's fate, a beloved queen who was killed when Cersei blew up the Great Sept of Baelor.
",1
Daenerys has Tyrion discuss their plan of attack.,1
"Tyrion proposes using a combination of Tyrell and Dornish forces to lay siege to King's Landing, much to the chagrin of Olenna and Ellaria, who balk at the thought of using their own soldiers. Tyrion, however, insists that using the Unsullied and Dothraki would arouse the patriotism of Westerosi bannermen, who would see them as foreign invaders and potentially close ranks behind Cersei. He proposes sending Grey Worm and the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock instead, cutting off Cersei's retreat and dealing a massive blow to the morale of the Western army. In the meantime, the Greyjoy fleet will escort Ellaria back to Sunspear to rally the Dornish forces and then ferry them up the coast to King's Landing, bypassing the Stormlands and allowing the siege to commence early. Daenerys accepts Tyrion's proposal and reminds the others on her council that she will not be attacking King's Landing, and requests consenting approval from everyone, which they give.
",1
Daenerys receives advice from Olenna.,1
"Daenerys dismisses everyone except Lady Olenna. The Dragon Queen tells the Queen of Thorns she is aware that her motives are based on revenge for Cersei and not out of love for Daenerys. Daenerys insists that she will usher in an era of peace. Olenna, however, reflects that there was never a lasting peace under the Mad King, or any preceding Targaryen, for that matter. She tells Daenerys that Tyrion is a clever man but she herself has outlasted many clever men by not listening to their advice. Olenna says the lords of Westeros are sheep but Daenerys is not a sheep. She counsels Daenerys that if she's to rule Westeros, ""You're a dragon. Be a dragon.""
",1
"Later, Missandei visits Grey Worm to bid him farewell before his departure to Casterly Rock. Grey Worm confides that Missandei is his weakness, and when she expresses confusion, he tells her that the Good Masters of Astapor tortured the Unsullied by exposing them to their worst fears. For example, a fear of dogs led to being made to sleep with dogs, a fear of heights means climbing a cliff. If the young boy was afraid of drowning, he'd be thrown into the sea. If he drowns, it would be ""good"", and if he learns to swim, it would be ""good"" because only the fit survive. Grey Worm recalls that he was never the biggest/fastest/strongest but he was the most fearless warrior until he met Missandei. She replies that she also has to deal with fear and kisses him. Missandei strips naked and proceeds to undress Grey Worm. Grey Worm is reluctant to remove his trousers (presumably not wanting to horrify her with his castration scars) but eventually acquiesces to Missandei's wishes. The two of them then share an intimate sexual encounter.
",1
"In the throne room of the Red Keep, Queen Cersei Lannister gives a speech urging several nobles from the Reach, including Lord Randyll Tarly, to reaffirm their allegiance to the Iron Throne and not follow House Tyrell in supporting Daenerys. Cersei warns that the Targaryen's Dothraki and Unsullied hordes would pillage their lands and homes, and rape their women. When Lord Tarly points out that Daenerys has three dragons, Maester Qyburn replies that he is ""at work on a solution"".
",1
"Following the audience with Queen Cersei, Lord Tarly meets in private with Jaime Lannister, who wants to appoint him as his general. Tarly is unwilling to break his fealty to Lady Olenna Tyrell and is wary of the Lannisters, who ""cut [their rivals'] throats at weddings"". Jaime reminds Tarly that he also swore an oath to the Iron Throne, and tells him that Cersei is preferable to Daenerys and her foreign armies. Jaime also promises that Cersei will make Tarly the new Warden of the South.
",1
Cersei visits the skull of Balerion the Black Dread.,1
"At Winterfell, Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Davos Seaworth discuss the letter they received from Tyrion. Jon asks for Sansa's opinion and while Sansa remembers that Tyrion was kind to her and was unlike the rest of his family, she wonders if the message is truly from Tyrion. Jon confirms the letter's authenticity as it ends with the line ""For all dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes,"" which is what Tyrion told Jon when they first met. Even so, Sansa worries it is too big a risk and Jon concedes that now is not the right time to go to Dragonstone. Davos opines that Dany will make a good ally in the war to come against the White Walkers; Jon himself told him that wights are killed by fire, and what creatures just happen to breathe fire?
",1
"Some days later, Maester Wolkan brings Jon Snow a message from Samwell Tarly in the Citadel. Jon gathers the Northern lords in the main hall and announces that Sam's letter reveals there is a vein of dragon glass beneath Dragonstone. He adds that Lord Tyrion has invited him to Dragonstone to meet with Queen Daenerys and announces his decision to travel to Dragonstone to convince Daenerys to join their fight against the White Walkers, declaring that he plans to travel with Davos to White Harbor and sail to Dragonstone island. Lords Yohn Royce and Robett Glover voice their opinions that a Targaryen cannot be trusted, citing the atrocities committed by Daenerys's father. Lady Lyanna Mormont urges the King in the North to stay at home. Jon accepts that he is taking a risk but stresses that the fight against the White Walkers is more important, and they need Daenerys' aid if the North is to be saved. Jon emphasizes that the North is his home, it is part of him, and he will never stop fighting for it. Sansa reiterates her objection to Jon's leaving, and Jon tells Sansa that he is appointing her as ruler of the North in his absence as she is his sister, regent, and a Stark. Sansa accepts.
",1
Petyr admits his love for Sansa.,1
"In the catacombs beneath Winterfell, Petyr Baelish finds Jon Snow, who is visiting his father's tomb, and vouches that Tyrion can be trusted. Petyr tells Jon that while he and Eddard had their differences, they both loved Catelyn Stark. He notes Catelyn wasn't fond of Jon, and muses that perhaps Catelyn underestimated Jon's potential as Jon now stands as the North's best chance against the coming storm. When Jon, who clearly distrusts Baelish, says that Petyr shouldn't be there and that they have nothing to say to each other, Baelish replies that Jon should be grateful to him for saving him from death at the hands of Ramsay Bolton. Baelish insists he is not Jon's enemy. He tells Jon that he loves Sansa, as he loved Sansa's mother; a disgusted Jon, angered by this, lashes out and seizes Baelish by the throat, slamming him into a wall. He tells Baelish, ""Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself."" Outside, Jon, Davos, and several horsemen then prepare to ride south to White Harbor while Sansa watches from the castle battlements. Before he leaves, Jon looks at Sansa and they share a farewell moment. Petyr, emerging from the catacombs, gazes at Sansa.

"Arya Stark encounters Hot Pie at the Inn at the Crossroads, accosting him to give her some pie and ale. Hot Pie tells her that he has become a seasoned pie-master, and Arya mentions that she has had some experience baking two pies (omitting the fact that she served Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers to their father, the late Lord Walder Frey). When Hot Pie asks Arya if the lady knight Brienne of Tarth had found her, Arya gives an affirmative answer. When Hot Pie asks where she is traveling to, Arya replies that she is traveling to King's Landing for the Queen. Hot Pie tells her that Queen Cersei has blown up the Great Sept of Baelor and wonders why she is not heading to Winterfell.

Arya chooses home over Cersei.,1
"Arya replies that the Boltons occupy the castle, but Hot Pie informs her that the Boltons are now dead, killed during the Battle of the Bastards by her half-brother Jon Snow, who has been named King in the North. Arya decides to head north, and Hot Pie tells her not to worry about paying for the cost of the meal since she is a friend. As she leaves, Hot Pie remarks that Arya is pretty for someone whom he thought was a boy. Arya rides her horse into the frost-covered forest.

"Later, as Arya prepares to set up camp in a snowy, forested area, her horse is startled by several wolves. Before the wolves can attack her, they are silenced by their pack leader, which turns out to be Arya's direwolf Nymeria. Nymeria is initially apprehensive towards Arya but soon recognizes her former mistress. Arya tells her direwolf that she is going home and invites her to come with her. However, Nymeria turns and leaves with the pack. Arya watches in sadness and remarks, ""That's not you.""

"At the Citadel, Archmaester Ebrose and Samwell Tarly examine Jorah Mormont, whose greyscale has spread to his torso. The Archmaester tells Jorah that he should have cut off his lower arm instead of letting the infection spread. Ebrose states that Mormont is beyond saving. While it is customary for infected smallfolk to be sent to live with the stone men, Ebrose gives Mormont one more day, implying with a look at his sword that the anointed knight could choose to commit suicide instead. When Sam asks about sending condolences to Jorah's family at House Mormont, Jorah replies that he is estranged from his family.

Sam sneaks in and attempts to save Jorah from greyscale.,1
"Later, the Archmaester lectures Tarly about the art of writing history. Sam refuses to give up on Jorah and mentions that a previous Maester, Pylos, successfully treated two cases of advanced greyscale. Ebrose responds that Pylos contracted the disease himself and died of it; because of the risk, the procedure was declared forbidden.

"Undaunted, Sam decides to treat Jorah and secretly visits his quarters after dark. He tells Jorah, ""You're not dying today,"" reveals himself to be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, that he served under Jorah's father, the late Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and was present when he died. Sam gives Jorah rum to drink after taking a fortifying swig himself, telling him that the process will be painful. Sam also provides Jorah with a mouthguard so he can focus on biting down on it to help muffle his screams, as he explains that he's performing the procedure without permission. Sam's plan involves using a scalpel to separate and cut away Jorah's infected skin and then applying ointment to the exposed layer, though Jorah gives him a look that tells Sam he shouldn't bother trying to explain it to him. Despite experiencing the pain of having a patch of greyscale skin debrided, Jorah nods his consent for Sam to continue the debridement.

Yara and Ellaria's ships are attacked by Euron.,1
"On the Narrow Sea, Yara Greyjoy and her brother Theon Greyjoy travel aboard their portion of the Iron Fleet with their Dornish allies Ellaria Sand, her daughter Tyene, and Tyene's half-sisters Obara and Nymeria Sand. In their quarters, the Sand Snakes are lying in bed and argue about killing Lannisters. Elsewhere, Ellaria drinks Ironborn liquor with Yara and Theon, which she compares unfavorably to Dornish wine. Ellaria asks Yara if she had ever been to Dorne, to which Yara responds that she has been there a few times. Ellaria responds that there is a boy in every port in Dorne and Yara tells her, ""A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."" As they begin to flirt with one another and Ellaria motions for Theon to get her more wine, Yara explains Theon is not a servant but will be both her advisor and protector once she's killed her uncle. Yara puts her feet up on the table. Ellaria bends over Yara and spreads her legs apart across the table. Ellaria moves her hand up Yara's leg towards her crotch. Ellaria invites Theon to have a threesome with her and Yara, but Yara tells Ellaria, ""Leave him be."" While Yara and Ellaria began kissing, Yara's ship is struck. On the deck above, they discover that their fleet has been ambushed by Euron Greyjoy's portion of the Iron Fleet.

"Euron's flagship Silence rams Yara's ship and lands a boarding party, Euron at the forefront of the attack. Yara and her men fight fiercely but are overwhelmed by Euron's warriors. Tyene retreats below decks to protect her mother Ellaria on Yara's orders, while Obara and Nymeria fight against Euron's Ironborn. Obara fights Euron, who kills her by impaling her with her own spear. Nymeria attacks him with her whip but Euron strangles her to death with it. Though Tyene kills several Ironborn, she and Ellaria are overwhelmed. Ellaria tells the Ironborn to kill them quickly, but they are taken captive instead.

Euron holds Yara hostage.,1
"Yara and Euron fight with axes as Yara's fleet burns in the night. Euron captures Yara and then goads ""little Theon"" to come save her. Theon is about to come to his sister's aid but panics when Euron's men begin mutilating the wounded sailors, reminding him of the tortures he suffered at Ramsay Bolton's hands. To Yara's dismay, Theon jumps overboard while Euron laughs with cruel glee. Theon clings to driftwood and sees Obara and Nymeria's corpses impaled on and hanged by the neck from the prow, respectively. Euron's fleet starts sailing towards King's Landing as Yara's fleet burns in the Narrow Sea, while Theon watches helplessly as the ship carrying his sister disappears into the night.

Tyrion's letter to Jon.,1
"Daenerys holds court. Tyrion backchannels. Cersei returns a gift. Jaime learns from his mistakes.
",1
"Euron parades the captives Yara, Ellaria, and Tyene through the streets of King's Landing, reveling in his victory all the way to the Red Keep. The crowd pelt Yara, Ellaria, and Tyene with rotting fruit. Impressed with his ""gift"", Cersei agrees to an alliance with the Lord Reaper and praises him as a true friend to the Crown. Ellaria spits at Cersei's feet while Ser Gregor Clegane is present among the Queensguard. When Euron demands his ""reward"", Cersei responds that he will get it once the war is over. Cersei appoints Euron as the commander of her naval forces and her brother Jaime Lannister as commander of her armies. Despite the fanfare, Jaime is privately hostile towards Euron and tells the Lord Reaper of Pyke that his head belongs on a spike. Euron tells Jaime that he desires Cersei and asks for tips about her sexual tastes, much to Jaime's silent fury.
",1
Euron brings Ellaria and Tyene as a gift to Cersei.,1
"Later, Cersei confronts Ellaria and Tyene in their cell, where both are gagged and chained to opposite walls. Accompanied by Ser Gregor Clegane and Qyburn, Cersei remembers Oberyn Martell's showdown with Ser Gregor during Tyrion's second trial by combat, sadistically recalling the Red Viper's savage death to Ellaria and how Ellaria screamed at the sight of it. She later provokes Ellaria's sorrow by recalling Oberyn's fearsome skill with a spear, and how that eventually didn't stop Gregor from killing him, as well as inferring that Oberyn brought his death on himself by taunting Gregor instead of just leaving him to die. She then remembers raising Myrcella, and the fact that Ellaria murdered her.
",1
Ellaria and Tyene meet their fate.,1
"Cersei goes on to praise Tyene's beauty to Ellaria and suggesting that she is Ellaria's favorite. She contemplates how she will execute Ellaria or Tyene, cruelly suggesting Ser Gregor kill them the way he killed Oberyn. However, opining that it would be too fast a death, she kisses Tyene with the Long Farewell, citing poetic justice for Myrcella's murder, and torments Ellaria by having Qyburn confirm the uncertainty of when the girl will die, but also the inevitability of it, as the Long Farewell varies on how long it takes to kill, depending on the strength of its victim's constitution. Cersei tells Ellaria that she will be left alive to witness the event as well as to watch her daughter's ""beautiful face crumble into bone and dust"", and that she will be made to contemplate the things she has done, even to the point of being force-fed if she tries to starve herself to death. Before leaving, Cersei orders that torches be routinely replaced so that Ellaria doesn't miss a moment of Tyene's demise as Ellaria frantically struggles against her chains in a futile effort to reach her daughter.

"Later that evening, Jaime is drinking wine for supper when Cersei arrives and kisses him. He initially rebuffs her advances but ultimately consents to sex. The next morning, following an incestuous night with Jaime, Cersei answers the door for a servant who announces that a visitor from Braavos has arrived. Cersei acknowledges the message and requests fresh sheets.
",1
"Cersei meets with Tycho Nestoris, a representative from the Iron Bank of Braavos, who offers his condolences for the loss of her son Tommen Baratheon. Tycho thanks Cersei for eradicating the Faith Militant, which he describes as superstition. Cersei realizes that the Iron Bank wants to bet on the strongest faction. Cersei tells Tycho that Lord Euron controls the sea and is an ally for the time being. Cersei convinces Nestoris to side with the Lannisters by denouncing Daenerys as a revolutionary rather than a monarch. She promises that the Lannisters will pay their debts unlike the Dothraki and former slaves. Cersei vows to pay the Crown's debts in full within a fortnight and invites Nestoris to stay in King's Landing. Nestoris is pleased and describes Cersei as her ""father's daughter"".

Sansa and Bran reunite in Winterfell.,1
"At Winterfell, Sansa and Petyr Baelish learn from Maester Wolkan that they have about 4,000 bushels of wheat. Sansa realizes that they don't have enough food for the coming winter. She advocates building granaries to stockpile for a famine. Sansa also orders Yohn Royce to see that the armor made for their armies is outfitted with leather to keep warm. While walking, Baelish and Sansa talk about the threat of Cersei. Petyr urges her to fight every battle and to look for threats in every corner. They are then interupted by a guard who tells Lady Stark that she has received a visitor, who turns out to be her younger brother Bran Stark, accompanied by Meera Reed.

"Following a tearful reunion, the two siblings retreat to the Godswood, where Sansa tells Bran how she wishes Jon were there with them at Winterfell. Bran agrees, noting that he needs to speak to Jon. When Sansa points out that Bran is the rightful Lord of Winterfell since he is the last remaining true-born son of Ned Stark, he refuses the position, stating that he is the Three-Eyed Raven and thus can't be any sort of Lord. Sansa begs for Bran to explain what that means, and Bran then demonstrates his newly-acquired power to a skeptical Sansa by recalling details from the night of her marriage to Ramsay Bolton. Startled, Sansa walks away in shock and tears.

Ebrose realizes that somebody treated Jorah, but Mormont claims the belief that rest and the climate healed him. Ebrose lets Jorah go but orders a private audience with Samwell Tarly later that evening; it's obvious to Jorah and Sam that he's in trouble, but Sam says he'll find out by just how much in the evening. Jorah tells Sam that he is returning to Daenerys because she gave him hope and a sense of purpose. Jorah thanks Sam for saving him, and Sam says it's the least he could do given everything that Jeor Mormont did for him. Jorah is clearly moved when he takes Sam's offered farewell handshake, having expected to never touch another person ever again.

"In private, Ebrose chastises Sam for embarking on an illegal healing procedure due to the high risk of infection. Nevertheless, he praises Sam for his success, noting that it was an extraordinarily difficult operation, and asks for the secret of his success. Sam replies that he simply read the books and followed the instructions. Ebrose ""congratulates"" Sam by telling him to make fresh copies of several old manuscripts and scrolls so their knowledge can be preserved, explaining that Sam's reward is not being expelled from the Citadel.

"Jon and Davos arrive at Dragonstone, and are immediately greeted by Tyrion and Missandei. Upon meeting, Tyrion addresses Jon as the bastard of Winterfell, while Jon addresses him as the dwarf of Casterly Rock  the two share a friendly grin. Jon observes that Tyrion has picked up some scars. Jon also introduces Davos while Tyrion introduces Missandei, who requests that they surrender their weapons. Jon and his entourage hand over their weapons to Daenerys's Dothraki guards.
",1
"On the walk to the castle, Missandei walks with Davos and tells him that she comes from the island of Naath. Davos remarks that it was a paradise full of palm trees. Jon and Tyrion talk about Sansa Stark's marriage to Tyrion. Tyrion assures Jon that it was a sham and was never consummated, and remarks that she is a lot smarter than she lets on, to which Jon agrees. While Jon is aware about the fate of the previous Starks who had met with the Mad King, Jon insists that he is not a Stark. Jon and Davos are startled at the sight of Drogon and Viserion flying low over the causeway and dive to the ground, while an amused Missandei and Tyrion retain their composure. Offering Jon a hand up, Tyrion says he wishes he could tell Jon he'll get used to the dragons  but no one is quite used to them except their mother, who is waiting for Jon within.

Davos and Jon arrive and see Dany's dragons for the first time.,1
"On the cliffs overlooking the beach, Varys confronts Melisandre about her reluctance to see the King in the North. Melisandre responds to his prodding that she parted on bad terms with Jon and Davos Seaworth because of terrible mistakes she made. She says that now that she has ""brought ice and fire together"", she will end her previous habit of ""whispering in the ears of kings"" and indicates her intention to travel to Volantis. When Varys suggests that she should not return to Westeros, Melisandre replies that she will return one last time, ""as [she] is destined to die in Westeros... just like [Varys].""
",1
"In the throne room, Missandei introduces Daenerys by her many titles. At Jon's awkward prompting, a slightly amused Davos introduces Jon simply as King in the North. Daenerys thanks Jon for travelling so far but refers to him as a Lord. Davos begs to differ, but Daenerys responds that there has been no King in the North ever since Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror and adds that an oath lasts for perpetuity. Dany then reiterates her demand for Jon to bend the knee, but he refuses. When Dany accuses him of breaking faith with House Targaryen, Jon reminds her that the Mad King burnt his grandfather Rickard Stark and uncle Brandon.
Daenerys apologizes for her father's actions and stresses that children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents. She then urges Jon to renew the historic allegiance between their two great houses. Jon expresses agreement with Daenerys's view that children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents, but argues that he is not beholden to his ancestors' oaths. Jon tells her that he has come because he needs her help--and she needs his. Dany reminds him that she has three dragons and Dothraki who have pledged themselves to her.

Jon Snow meets with Daenerys Targaryen.,1
"Getting to the point of his trip, Jon likens the fighting between the Great Houses to children squabbling over a game. Jon points out that the army of the dead is their true enemy. Daenerys is sceptical, but Tyrion vouches for Jon. Jon says that they need to make cause to fight against the army of the dead. Daenerys asks if Jon knew if his father knew that his best friend had sent assassins to kill her as a baby (not knowing that Lord Eddard Stark had opposed King Robert Baratheon's assassination plot). Dany recounts that she was targeted by assassins, enslaved, raped, and defiled but that her faith in herself rather the gods kept her going. Daenerys talks about the miracle of her dragons' hatching and the Dothraki crossing the Narrow Sea. When Daenerys reiterates that she is destined to rule the Seven Kingdoms, Jon retorts that she will be ruling over a graveyard if the Night King is not defeated.
",1
"Tyrion says they cannot split their forces. Davos then speaks up for his liege lord and tells Dany that Jon won the support of the Wildlings and fought the White Walkers, but Jon cuts him off when he tries to mention the true outcome of the Mutiny at Castle Black. Davos says that it doesn't matter who bends the knee, as if they don't put aside their enemities to focus on the undead they will all die, but Tyrion doesn't see the point of Jon's refusal to submit. When Jon disputes Daenerys' claims to Queenship, Dany responds that he is in open rebellion since he has declared himself King in the North. Daenerys then receives a message from Varys. Dany orders Missandei to give Jon and his followers food and lodging, then ominously gives a series of clipped orders, in Dothraki, to Qhono. When Jon asks if he is a prisoner, she says ""not yet"".
",1
"Varys tells her that the Targaryen fleet was ambushed by Euron Greyjoy's Iron Fleet in the Narrow Seas. He informs her that Yara Greyjoy, Ellaria Sand, and her daughter Tyene Sand were captured. In response to this grim news, Daenerys allows Jon and Davos to stay until they can reach a proper agreement.

Jon examines Dragonstone.,1
"Later, Jon and Tyrion discuss his predicament. Jon is unhappy that he is a prisoner while the White Walkers and the Night King still pose a threat. Tyrion says he trusts the word of Jeor Mormont and Jon. Jon asks Tyrion how he can convince people about the existence of things which they don't believe exist. Jon wants to help his people and is frustrated with the deadlock. Tyrion encourages Jon not to give up. When Jon remarks that he is a fool for going south, Tyrion reassures him that the Mad King's daughter is not her father and has protected people from ""monsters,"" telling him to speak with her servants. Tyrion asks if there is something he can do to help Jon.
",1
"After learning about the dragon glass beneath Dragonstone, Tyrion speaks with Dany about Jon's request to access the material. Dany is preoccupied with the loss of two allies. Tyrion convinces Dany to let Jon have the dragon glass in order to court his allegiance, and tells her to give him something so that they can focus on Casterly Rock. Dany listens to her Hand's advice, but seems more preoccupied with what Davos was about to say about Jon in the throne room. Tyrion dismisses it as Northern hyperbole.
",1
Jon converses with Daenerys.,1
"While Dany is watching over her dragons, she is joined by Jon. Dany tells Jon that she named her dragons Rhaegal and Viserion after her brothers Rhaegar and Viserys Targaryen. Jon realizes that Tyrion has been petitioning her. Dany tells Jon she is determined to remove Cersei. She allows Jon to mine the dragon glass and agrees to provide men and equipment. Desperate for some validation, he asks if she believes in the Night King and White Walkers; she tells him to get to work.

"In the waters of the Narrow Sea near Dragonstone, Theon Greyjoy is fished aboard by one of the few surviving ships of Yara Greyjoy's fleet. When the Ironborn question him on what happened to Yara, Theon lies and mentions that he tried in vain to save her, leaving them unimpressed. One of the men replies that he wouldn't be here if he tried to save her.

"In the Chamber of Painted Table, Dany confers with her advisers Tyrion, Varys, and Missandei. Dany proposes going out with her dragons to hunt Euron Greyjoy's Iron Fleet, but Missandei and Tyrion argue against it: they have no idea where Euron is, and all it would take is for one stray arrow to kill Daenerys and the dragons would be uncontrollable. Tyrion thinks that the Lannisters will put up a fierce fight for Casterly Rock. Tyrion tells her that the gates and walls of Casterly Rock are impregnable to siege. However, his father Tywin assigned Tyrion to build the sewers in his youth. Tyrion tells them that he built a secret tunnel through a cove to bring in prostitutes. Tyrion's remarks are interspersed with scenes of the Unsullied trying to storm the fortress.

The Unsullied take Casterly Rock.,1
"In the Westerlands, Grey Worm and the Unsullied lay siege to the Lannister seat of Casterly Rock but face fierce resistance at the gates and walls. The Unsullied managed to sneak in through Tyrion's secret cove tunnel. Following fierce fighting, Grey Worm managed to overwhelm the garrison and capture the castle. Grey Worm quickly realizes that the Lannisters have only installed a skeletal garrison. Overlooking the battlements, Grey Worm questions a wounded Lannister soldier about where the main Lannister forces are and realizes that they have stumbled into a trap. Euron's Iron Fleet sneaks up on the Unsullied fleet from behind and unleashes projectiles, setting many Targaryen ships ablaze.

Olenna has her final words with Jaime.,1
"Olenna again asks Jaime how he plans to kill her. Jaime tells her of Cerseis idea of having her whipped and beheaded, or flayed alive and hanged, but he talked her out of those ideas. He then produces a small vial and empties its contents into one of the glasses of wine, giving it to Olenna who then drinks it after Jaime confirms that it will be a painless death. Olenna reflects on the horrible way that Joffrey died, and the gruesome details that the poison caused; she admits that part was unintentional on her part, as she had never seen the strangler work in person before. Shocked into silence, Jaime stares at her, realizing at last who really killed his eldest son and let his brother take the blame, setting in motion the deaths of Oberyn Martell and Tywin Lannister. Satisfied at his horror, Olenna insists that he tell Cersei that she was the one who murdered her son  a final cutting barb from the Queen of Thorns.

"At Winterfell, Littlefinger meets with the recently-returned Bran Stark. Apparently hoping to exploit disunity among the Stark children, he tries to ingratiate himself with Bran, Ned Stark's last trueborn son and rightful heir to Winterfell. Littlefinger gives Bran a gift, the very same Valyrian steel dagger that a cutthroat tried to kill him with while he was in a coma right after he was pushed from one of Winterfell's towers. Bran is still emotionally detached, however, from all of his visions as the new Three-Eyed Raven, and is generally uninterested, only absent-mindedly asking who the dagger belonged to. With a wry look, Littlefinger responds that, in a way, this is the question which started the entire War of the Five Kings. Bran's mother Catelyn Stark took the dagger south with her to King's Landing to try to find who it belonged to, convinced the Lannisters sent the cutthroat to kill Bran (and left it there in Ned's possession, from whom Littlefinger recovered it). Littlefinger tries to manipulate Bran by remarking on how much chaos he must have lived through to get back to Winterfell. In response, Bran looks at Littlefinger and says, ""Chaos is a ladder,"" quoting back Littlefinger's own words to him, which Littlefinger said to Varys in King's Landing years before and which Bran couldn't possibly have been physically present to hear himself. Visibly unnerved, Littlefinger is startled by Meera Reed entering the room. He takes his leave of Bran, calling him ""Lord Stark"", though again Bran insists he's not a Lord.
",1
"After Littlefinger leaves, Meera notices Bran's new wheelchair. He explains Maester Wolkan built it for him. She tells him that she has come to tell him she's leaving and say goodbye; she promised to keep him safe, and now that he's back in Winterfell surrounded by his Stark forces, he's as safe as anyone will be before the coming war. Meera explains that when the White Walkers arrive, she wants to be with her family, so she is heading back to the Neck to assist the Crannogmen. She says he doesn't need her in Winterfell anymore; Bran agrees with her and with blank emotional affect, simply thanking her for her help. Meera becomes angry that this is all he has to say after everything they went through, when Hodor and Summer and even her own brother Jojen died for Bran. Bran responds that he isn't really ""Bran Stark"" anymore, but the Three-Eyed Raven. He ""remembers"" the events of Bran Stark's life, but now ""remembers"" vast amounts of other accumulated memories from centuries upon centuries. Everything that once affected ""Bran Stark"" now seems distant and trivial to him. In horror, Meera cries that he ""died"" in the cave and leaves.
",1
"Meanwhile, Arya Stark finally returns to Winterfell, after leaving years before with her father, Sansa, and King Robert Baratheon's entourage, right after Bran's fall from the tower. Arya rides up to the gates and dismounts, but the guards don't believe her when she says she is in fact Arya Stark, convinced that Arya has been dead for years. Arya asks that they send word to Maester Luwin and Rodrik Cassel, hoping either can prove her identity but unaware they are both dead. The guards gruffly say that no one by those names is there, so Arya asks for Jon. The two say he'd just left Winterfell. Arya asks who is in charge of Winterfell then, and they say ""Lady Stark"" (who Arya realizes is her sister). They try to brush her aside, but she dodges them with her assassin's reflexes, and insists that one way or another, she's getting in. She explains to them that if she is Arya, they'll be in a lot of trouble for turning her away, and if she isn't, she won't last long in Winterfell anyway. Mildly concerned, they agree to at least let her in the courtyard but insist that she stay put while they consult Sansa so they can disprove her identity. As soon as they take their eyes off her, however, she slips away. The two guards go to inform Sansa and try to wave it aside as just some impostor, but when they mention she asked for Luwin and Cassel, she instantly realizes it must be Arya, and already knows where she has gone.
",1
"Sansa finds Arya where she expected, in the crypts looking over their father Ned's grave. They are happy to see each other but so much has happened to both of them in the past few years that they are at first awkward, unsure of what to say. Arya asks if she has to call Sansa ""Lady Stark"" now, to which Sansa firmly insists yes, and laughs. They smile and hug, though still a bit unsure. Arya notes that Jon left her in charge and smiles when Sansa says that she hopes Jon will be back soon. He will be both surprised and happy to see Arya, Sansa remembering how happy Jon was to see her when they were reunited. The sisters then look sadly on their father's grave statue. Arya says it doesn't really look like him. Sansa acknowledges that everyone who knew his face well is dead. Arya points out they're not.
",1
"Arya then asks if Sansa killed Joffrey as everyone believes. She explains she actually didn't, though she wished she had. Arya remarks that he was always at the top of her ""list"". This confuses Sansa, and Arya explains that she'd been keeping a list of everyone she was going to kill, at which they both laugh. Finally, Sansa asks how Arya got back, but she only says her road wasn't a pleasant one. Sansa says hers wasn't either. They hug again, earnestly and warmly. Sansa then informs Arya that Bran is home too. Arya is elated, but her face falls when Sansa makes no mention of Rickon, immediately realizing that Rickon is dead.
",1
"Sansa brings Arya to Bran in the Godswood, where he is lost in thought by the Weirwood heart tree. Arya is saddened to see him so paralyzed. Still somewhat detached even at the sight of Arya, he says he isn't surprised she's alive because he saw her at the Crossroads. Arya is confused, and Sansa explains that Bran is having ""visions"" now. Bran says he thought Arya was going to King's Landing, and when Sansa asks why she would head there of all places, he again startles them both by saying it's because Cersei is on her list of names (which he can't possibly be aware of through normal means). Sansa asks who else is on her list, but she says most of them besides Cersei are actually dead already.
",1
"They then remark on the Valyrian steel dagger in his lap, and he explains that Littlefinger gave it to him, thinking he'd want it. Despite it being such a horrible keepsake that nearly killed him and indirectly set off a chain of events leading to his parents' deaths, he is still listless and disinterested in it. Arya is confused as to why a common cuthroat would have a rare, priceless blade of Valyrian steel. Bran matter-of-factly says that someone very wealthy wanted him dead, and gave it to the assassin. Sansa acknowledges she doesn't actually trust Littlefinger and he'd never give anyone anything unless expecting something in return.
",1
Ned and Catelyn Stark's surviving children are reunited.,1
"Bran says that doesn't matter, because he doesn't even want it. Instead, Bran hands it to Arya and says she can have it, saying the dagger would be ""wasted on a cripple"". Arya slowly takes the dagger and looks at it.
",1
"Sansa, Bran, and Arya - the three remaining trueborn Stark children - proceed back to Winterfell's castle courtyard together, with Arya pushing Bran in his wheelchair. Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne see them from afar, all three of Catelyn Stark's surviving children reunited. Pod says Catelyn would be proud of Brienne, but she chides that she did next to nothing. Pod says he disagrees with ""my lady"", and Brienne starts to correct him that she doesn't consider herself a ""lady"", but then stops halfway and just thanks him for the compliment.
",1
"Some time later, Brienne is going through a vigorous sword practice session with Podrick, knocking him down when he overextends himself. Impressed, Arya interrupts and says she'd like to spar with Brienne, the woman who beat the Hound in combat. Sansa and Littlefinger watch on silently from the walkway above. Brienne goes easy on her at first, but then Arya completely outmaneuvers Brienne using the Water Dance training she received from Syrio Forel, augmented by her training with the Faceless Men. Arya achieves many openings that would be a killing blow if she wanted them to be. Surprised that such a young girl is so skilled, Brienne stops holding back, leading to a more grueling sparring session. Brienne actually manages to knock Needle out of Arya's hand but she simply switches to the Valyrian steel dagger she had in her belt. Arya uses her speed and agility to compensate for Brienne's strength and size to overwhelm her - until Brienne actually manages to bring her brute strength to bear on a fast moving target by landing a kick on Arya's chest that sends her falling down. Ultimately, they reach a stalemate, with each of them holding a blade at the others' throat. Brienne asks Arya who taught her to fight like that, and she simply responds, ""no one"". Arya takes her leave of Brienne, both mutually impressed, as Sansa looks down baffled and concerned at how her sister reached such a deadly skill level. Arya herself then glares at an equally surprised Littlefinger.

"Cersei meets with Tycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank of Braavos in her atrium containing a large floor map of Westeros. Tycho is pleased that Cersei will use the captured gold to pay off the Iron Throne's massive debts to the bank, and he engages in overt flattery by saying that she is as cunning at military strategy as her father Tywin was, if not more so.

"Now that the Lannisters' old debts will be mostly paid off, and the Iron Bank's faith in them somewhat reassured by their recent military victories, Cersei wants to take out new loans to strengthen her position in the war, so she can finish securing control over the rest of the continent. They discuss that Cersei wants to use the money to hire foreign Sellsword companies to bolster the depleted Lannister military ranks. Specifically, she reveals that she has had Qyburn make overtures to hire the best and largest private mercenary army in all of the Free Cities: the Golden Company. Tycho assures her that the Iron Bank will be delighted to help her with these future endeavors, once it receives the gold she is bringing them.

"What happened between Missandei and Grey Worm? ""Many things"".",1
"On Dragonstone, Daenerys Targaryen and Missandei make their way down to the beach to meet Jon Snow. Missandei is worried about Grey Worm because they haven't heard any news from Casterly Rock yet. Daenerys asks what happened between her and Grey Worm, and Missandei wryly says ""many things"", smiling. Jon then leads Daenerys on a tour of the long-abandoned Valyrian dragonglass mine that Samwell Tarly told him about. The mine is ancient and impressive, used by the First Men long before the Valyrians came to Dragonstone. But this is not why Jon asked Daenerys to come.
",1
"As they proceed deeper into the mines led by torchlight, Jon shows her cave paintings they discovered left behind by the Children of the Forest, filled with arcane magical symbols. Daenerys is stunned that the mythical Children stood where they are standing now, thousands upon thousands of years ago, long before mankind ever arrived in Westeros. Jon says this isn't exactly true, leading her into another chamber, this one filled with narrative drawings of the Children and the First Men. Daenerys wonders if the Children and First Men fought each other, but Jon then shows her ancient carvings of the White Walkers themselves, one of which Jon recognizes as an image of the Night King. Jon explains that the Children of the Forest and the First Men only managed to drive off the White Walkers the first time during the Long Night because they chose to join together to fight off their own extinction, and that is the choice between Jon and Daenerys now.
",1
"Jon asks Daenerys to ally with him to defeat the Night King. When Daenerys says that she will fight for him and the North after he bends the knee, Jon tells her that the North won't accept a southern ruler again after everything that has happened to them. Daenerys urges that they will if their king does. If his point in showing her the cave drawings was that she should swallow her pride and ally with him because the White Walkers are such a world-ending threat, by the same token, the North should submit to her, because their survival should outweigh their pride.
",1
"Hearing of the military disaster at the Sack of Highgarden, Daenerys and her allies argue about what to do next.",1
"As they exit the cave to the beach, they are joined by Varys and Tyrion, with grave looks on their faces. They inform her that the Unsullied succeeded in capturing Casterly Rock, only to then reveal the disaster which just occurred at Highgarden as Tyrion's military strategy fell apart. Casterly Rock was only a feint and the Lannisters didn't bother defending it, in order to make a surprise attack south which sacked Highgarden. Daenerys is furious and struggles to keep her temper, as now all three of her major allies in Westeros are gone and all she has gained is a castle with no supplies. She snaps at Tyrion, blaming his cautious strategy for losing them Dorne, the Iron Islands (Yara's forces), and now the Reach. She then accuses Tyrion of wanting to use a light hand against the Lannisters because they're his own people. Tyrion insists that they still have just enough ships left to at least shuttle the Dothraki from Dragonstone to the nearby mainland coast; even with the loss of all her other allies, her combined Unsullied/Dothraki forces are still the largest single army in Westeros. Daenerys fumes that her vast numbers are useless if she can't feed them all, as that was the Reach's true strategic value. Daenerys decides she has had enough of clever plans, and will use the Dothraki and her dragons in a direct assault to turn the tide of the war back in her favor. She desires to assault the Red Keep with all three of her dragons, intending to raze it to the ground with all her enemies inside it, but Jon argues against such a course of action when she asks him his opinion; by bringing dragons back to life and breaking the back of the slave trade, Daenerys has proven she might be capable of doing things differently. However, if she uses her dragons to ""melt castles and burn cities"", she will be no different from any of the more tyrannical of her Targaryen ancestors who came before her.

"Later, Jon and Davos Seaworth proceed back up to the castle. Davos remarks that Jon seems attracted to Daenerys. Jon says Daenerys has a good heart but brushes Davos' observation aside, saying he doesn't ""have time for that"" as he has seen the Night King and his horde of the undead. Jon stresses that they need to ally with Daenerys, because the North itself is largely depleted of soldiers after so many years of war (and the Red Wedding), so they only have maybe 10,000 soldiers or less left (to which Davos corrects ""fewer"").
",1
"They then run into Missandei again, who politely enquires why Jon's surname is ""Snow"" even though House Stark has ruled the North for centuries, and his father Ned and brother Robb both had the surname ""Stark"", while he doesn't. Jon explains that because his parents weren't married, he is bastard-born as a result and uses the regional surname 'Snow' - the name reserved for highborn Northern bastards of nobility. Davos asks Missandei if they have similar customs for bastards on Naath, Missandei's birthplace. Missandei explains that ""Marriage"" as such does not exist in Naath, so she finds the idea of a ""bastard"" to be quite an alien concept. Davos remarks that it sounds liberating. He then asks why she left, to which Missandei finally reveals that she was taken by slavers, to be freed only years later by Daenerys. When Davos suggests Missandei simply traded one master for another, she counters that she and all the freed slaves serve Daenerys because they choose to. Davos keeps pushing, asking what would happen if Missandei decided to return to Naath immediately. She responds that Daenerys would give her a ship and wish her good fortune.

"Jon confronts Theon, sparing him only for rescuing Sansa from Ramsay Bolton",1
"While they are still on the causeway, they see a lone ironborn ship approaching the island, a survivor of Yara Greyjoy's fleet. Theon Greyjoy himself and some of his men come to shore on a rowboat. As Theon disembarks, he is stunned to see Jon Snow, whom he had had last seen leaving Winterfell to join the Night's Watch. Since then, Theon had betrayed House Stark, a factor (albeit not the only one) that nearly destroyed House Stark and contributed to the deaths of two of Jon's half-brothers, Robb and Rickon. Jon is stunned for a moment as well. Theon walks up to Jon and asks him if Sansa, Jon's half-sister, is all right. A furious Jon angrily grabs Theon by his coat and shakes him, remembering Theon's past treachery. Jon tells Theon that what he did to save Sansa is the only reason that he is not killing him on the spot and releases him. Visibly relieved, Theon informs them that Euron Greyjoy attacked their fleet and took Yara prisoner. He says he has returned to ask Daenerys's help in saving her. Jon grudgingly tells him that Daenerys has just left.

"At Highgarden, Jaime Lannister coordinates the soldiers loading up the spoils of war for transport. The Sack of Highgarden allowed them to seize all of House Tyrell's substantial gold stores, which they send ahead to King's Landing first, before moving on to securing grain shipments. Jaime procures a large bag of gold coins and gives it to Bronn as payment for his services. Bronn, however, is annoyed that this isn't the full reward he was promised, which included a wife from the nobility and a castle. He then half-seriously asks why Jaime doesn't just grant him Highgarden, as they need someone to rule it. Jaime replies that they are at war, Highgarden requires significant upkeep, and Daenerys could arrive at any moment to take it. When Bronn remarks on the riches Jaime is packing up, Jaime says they are not his and the gold will be used to repay the Iron Bank. Bronn is not satisfied and Jaime says when they win the war, Bronn can choose from any castle he likes. He has Bronn assist Randyll Tarly and Dickon Tarly continue seizing grain supplies in the northern Reach.
",1
"Some time later, Jaime's Lannister army has advanced much farther north, and reaches the Blackwater Rush. Lord Randyll Tarly comes to Jaime and says they should hurry to get all of their grain wagons over the Blackwater river to King's Landing, as they will be vulnerable if their formation is caught on both sides of the river. Jaime agrees, but Randyll suggests flogging the stragglers to motivate them. Jaime urges that his soldiers fought well at Highgarden, however, and he should at least give them a fair warning first instead of launching right into the flogging. Jaime and Bronn then encounter Randyll's son Dickon Tarly again. Jaime asks what he thought of his first taste of battle, and Dickon nervously claims it was glorious, only to then dejectedly admit that he was quite conflicted. House Tarly had been loyal vassals of the Tyrells for generations; he knew many of the men they killed, even hunted side by side with them. Jaime replies those men didn't deserve to die but says the fault belongs to Olenna Tyrell because she choose to side with Daenerys Targaryen against Queen Cersei. Dickon then outright confesses that the aftermath was horrible, particularly the stench of corpses. Bronn playfully taunts that Dickon, a sheltered nobleman, finally learned that men empty their bowels when they die.
",1
"Daenerys's huge Dothraki horde descends on Jaime's Lannister army, in the Battle of the Goldroad.",1
"The Lannister army and wagon train continue east, approaching a river. Jaime and Bronn are then surprised to hear what sounds like distant thunder, until they realize it must be approaching cavalry. Jaime and Randyll shout for their soldiers to form up, which they manage to do before the enemy crests over the horizon: a massive, 100,000-strong horde of Dothraki cavalry, armed to the teeth and baying for blood. Bronn advises that Jaime ride ahead to King's Landing, but Jaime insists he will not abandon his men. Bronn bluntly tells him the Dothraki will quickly overwhelm the Lannister lines and Jaime is too valuable as a commander to stay and fight, but Jaime insists that they have a chance if they hold.
",1
The mobile Dothraki light cavalry race through the hole made in the Lannister lines to start enveloping them.,1
"Lannister heavy infantry rally around Jaime and Randyll, and a fierce melee ensues.",1
"Daenerys switches to making strafing runs with her dragon, across the Lannister formations.",1
"In an instant, Jaime and Bronn look to the sky in awe and horror as all other sound is drowned out by a massive roar, a roar not heard on the battlefields of Westeros in over a century and a half. Above the approaching Dothraki the Lannister army sees a huge adult dragon part the cloud cover itself and heading straight for their lines: Drogon, ridden by Daenerys Targaryen herself. Drogon outpaces the Dothraki, and at Daenerys's command ""Dracarys"", he blasts a torrent of fire through the Lannister ranks in a straight line from front to back, punching a hole in their formation. The highly mobile Dothraki light cavalry immediately sweep through it and wheel around to catch those parts of the Lannister lines in an enveloping move.
",1
"The Lannister-Tarly lines around Jaime and Randyll, however, manage to rally under their leadership. The Dothraki charge into the Lannister lines head-on, but meet stiff resistance as their spear wall holds firm. Though they are outnumbered, the Lannister soldiers are better armed with heavy infantry, and highly disciplined, battle-hardened veterans from years of war. Dothraki horse-archers let off shots before charging into their ranks, but highly-trained Tarly archers return fire, doing as much if not more damage, as the Dothraki wear less armor.
",1
"The Lannister army holds their line for a time, but their enemy has the advantage of weight in numbers, and the tide turns slowly against them. The sheer tide of horses smashes through the shield wall, opening up gaps for those behind to charge through. For a moment it looks like Jaime might at least be able to force the Dothraki to a standstill - but then Daenerys wheels out of the air again, devastating the Lannister formations. No longer trying to punch mere holes through their lines, she switches to outflanking the Lannister ranks, burning a vast horizontal swath of men from left to right, obliterating much of the Lannister wagon train in the process. Men are flash-burned into nothing but ash which crumbles to the touch, or cooked alive in their own superheated armor as they struggle to rip it off, dousing themselves in the river.
",1
"Jaime rallies Lannister & Tarly archers to shoot volleys at the dragon, but in vain.",1
"Nonetheless, Jaime manages to rally his remaining forces a second time, desperately taking command of a group of surviving Lannister and Tarly archers and directing them to concentrate their fire at the dragon: Drogon might not be vulnerable to common arrow fire, but his rider is. If they can manage to kill Daenerys herself, who has risked appearing in open battle, the entire war could end in a day, no matter their losses. Daenerys sees the attack coming, however, and banks Drogon up so the arrow volley harmlessly bounces off the armored scales on his belly. He then blasts the archer formations with fire. Jaime avoids the flames and is surrounded by enemies, but he manages to carve a path through the Dothraki with his Valyrian steel sword Widow's Wail to try to reach safety. He gets in trouble for a moment when he locks swords with a Dothraki duel-wielding two arakhs, but Dickon Tarly stabs the Dothraki from behind, saving Jaime.
",1
"Bronn loads up the anti-dragon scorpion, and takes aim at Daenerys.",1
"Jaime commands Bronn to reach Qyburn's anti-dragon scorpion-bolt launcher (as Jaime cannot fire it one-handed), which they happen to have on hand and which was one of the few wagons not destroyed in the flames. After a moment's hesitation, Bronn fights his way back, killing several Dothraki until one cuts off his horse's leg and sends him sprawling, losing his large bag of gold in the process. Bronn continues to fight his way back on foot, chased by the same Dothraki warrior, who follows him into the wagon he was looking for, just in time to stare down the business-end of the loaded scorpion. He barely has time to realize his fate before Bronn fires a bolt into him, flinging him twenty feet and pinning his corpse to another wagon. Bronn reloads the scorpion as fast as he can (it is meant to be crewed by a team of men), spots the dragon in the distance, and fires, but misses. Daenerys is startled by the scorpion-bolt flying a few feet from her head, scans the battlefield, and spots Bronn on the scorpion as he reloads.
",1
"Enraged at this direct attack on Drogon, Daenerys then leads Drogon on a direct charge diving straight down at Bronn on the scorpion launcher, who waits for her to approach close enough that he hopefully won't miss before she is right on top of him. He fires another shot, which impales Drogon's right shoulder. The mighty dragon lets out an awful screech and collapses in shock, helplessly dropping into a free-fall from hundreds of feet in the air.
",1
"Only receiving a flesh wound from the scorpion bolt in his shoulder, Drogon roasts the scorpion as Bronn jumps away.",1
"Bronn is elated, only for Daenerys to quickly break Drogon out of his fall right before they hit the ground, which would have killed them both. The surviving Lannister soldiers then realize that not only is the dragon not dead, he is in a lot of pain and extremely angry. Hovering above the river, Drogon sets his sights on the device which did this to him and angrily sends a fire-blast at the scorpion, destroying it a matter of seconds after Bronn narrowly jumps out of the way to safety.
",1
"The dragon's armored scales are so tough that the scorpion bolt only managed to cause superficial damage. Nonetheless, the flesh wound grounds Drogon, and he howls in pain and fury, destroying any masses of enemy soldiers that are foolish or unlucky enough to get near him. Daenerys dismounts and desperately tries to remove the scorpion bolt.
",1
"The battle turns into an utter rout, as the Lannister army is overwhelmed by the Dothraki and dragon-fire.",1
"By this point, the devastation caused by the dragon and the sheer number of Dothraki have totally overwhelmed the Lannister lines, and with the scorpion destroyed, their last hope is gone and the battle turns into an utter rout and massacre. The Dothraki, who live for combat, show the fleeing Westerosi no mercy and cut them down gleefully on and off horseback. Tyrion Lannister views the battle from the distance of a nearby hill, along with the Dothraki commander Qhono, who remarks that Tyrion's people can't fight. Tyrion looks gravely on the battlefield, realizing that these are in fact his own countrymen from the Westerlands and House Lannister being massacred, men who Tyrion had previously fought alongside at the Battles of the Green Fork and Blackwater. Many burning and dying men rush to the river to try to extinguish the flames.
",1
"Jaime makes a death-run at Daenerys and her downed dragon, charging through the devastation of the battlefield.",1
"Jaime reaches Daenerys, but Drogon defends his mother.",1
"Jaime, however, sees that Daenerys is grounded and immobilized, and realizes he still has one chance; if he can kill Daenerys, even now, he can end her invasion. Jaime grabs a spear and charges his horse across the flaming battlefield to make a death-run for Daenerys as she tends to her dragon. Tyrion swears under his breath, calling his brother a ""fucking idiot"", angry that he's going to get himself killed.
",1
"Just as Jaime is nearly on top of Daenerys, however, Drogon notices him amidst the chaos of the battle. Shielding Daenerys behind his head, the dragon opens his mouth and his throat glows with the promise of fiery death. Just as Drogon unleashes the flames, Bronn rides in and tackles Jaime off his horse, leaving their poor mounts to be consumed instead. They both fall into the river, where Jaime is weighed down by his armor, and sinks beneath the waters, in danger of drowning.
",1
Bronn pulls Jaime from the water.,1
"In the aftermath of the Battle of the Goldroad, Ser Bronn pulls Jaime Lannister from the depths of Blackwater Rush, and onto the shore, after Jaime's failed attempt to slay Daenerys Targaryen and end the war. Bronn tells Jaime the only reason he rescued him is that nobody gets to kill Jaime until Bronn gets the reward he's due from the Lannisters. Jaime, shellshocked, remarks on the destructive power Drogon alone unleashed, and realizes they are in great peril if Daenerys deploys all three in future battles. Bronn assures that he won't be around for such an assault, as Jaime laments his duty to report what happened to Cersei. Bronn thinks it would be safer for him to jump back into the river than deal with Cersei's wrath.
",1
Tyrion and Dany pitch to the lords of the Reach.,1
"Meanwhile on the Goldroad, Tyrion Lannister grimly assesses the carnage of the battle, seeing the ashes of wagons, horses and Lannister soldiers. The prisoners of war are being herded by the Dothraki to Daenerys, with Drogon (apparently none the worse from taking a scorpion bolt to the shoulder) perched behind her menacingly and majestically. Daenerys appeals to them, bringing up the rumors spread about her by Queen Cersei, and warnings of brutality that the Dragon Queen would bring - burning down homes, and murdering families. She assures she is not here to murder, but to destroy the wheel of power that rolls over the rich and poor alike, to no one's benefit but people like Cersei Lannister. She offers them a choice - bend the knee and join her in her quest to make the world a better place than ever before, or refuse and die. Tyrion looks at her apprehensively upon hearing this. Only a few kneel at first; Drogon, apparently insulted by their refusal to accept his mother's command, bellows at them and most quickly yield. However, Randyll Tarly, his son Dickon, and a handful of men refuse. Daenerys summons Randyll forward, where he insists he already has a Queen. Tyrion recalls he didn't pledge to Cersei until recently, and that she murdered the rightful Queen, destroying House Tyrell for good. He observes Randyll's allegiances are ""flexible"" to which Randyll answers there are no easy choices in war. He tells Tyrion that Cersei is at least a true Westerosi, and that Tyrion is a kinslayer, having killed his father, as well as supporting a foreigner, bringing savages to their continent. Daenerys accepts Randyll's answer, and prepares to carry out a sentence, but Tyrion intervenes with the possibility of sending Randyll to The Wall instead of death. Randyll replies Daenerys cannot send him to the Wall as she is not his Queen.
",1
Dickon and Randyll prepare to be executed.,1
"Daenerys signals for three Dothraki men to apprehend him, but Dickon suddenly speaks up insisting he will have to be killed too. Randyll, horrified, tries to silence his son. Tyrion reminds Dickon that he is the future of House Tarly and insists that he submit, reminding him what happened to House Tyrell. Randyll silently nods in agreement so his son may be spared. Dickon refuses to relent on his decision. Tyrion proposes to Daenerys about having them committed to the cells instead, but Daenerys, being ruthless but pragmatic, does not wish to grant the reputation of putting traitors in chains, or many would take advantage. She resumes her sentencing for them both, as they hold hands. Drogon unleashes his dragonfire, burning Randyll and Dickon alive and reducing them both to flame and ash in seconds, killing them instantly. Terrified, the remaining soldiers instantly kneel as Tyrion reflects uneasily over the execution.

"At the Godswood in Winterfell, Bran Stark wargs into a flock of ravens to fly over the Wall into the Lands of Always Winter. Through the ravens, he sees the Army of the Dead led by the White Walkers and the Night King, traveling south towards Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. His reconnaissance continues until the Night King sees the ravens, at which Bran severs the connection. He tells Maester Wolkan that they need to send ravens at once.

"Later, in Winterfell's council chamber, Arya Stark observes Regent Sansa Stark presiding over a meeting of the Northern lords. Saying that the King in the North should stay in the north, Lord Robett Glover and Lord Yohn Royce of The Vale of Arryn imply they made a mistake in their choice of ruler and that she take over power in the absence of her half-brother Jon Snow. However, Sansa insists Jon Snow is their true ruler who is doing what he believes is right for their people and that she is his regent. Following the meeting, Sansa confides her frustration in the Northern lords with Arya, who calls Sansa out for diplomatically handling their concerns instead of shutting the lords down. Arya thinks that she should not let the lords get away with insulting Jon and hints at assassinating them. Sansa disagrees, at which Arya calls attention to the fact that Sansa is using their parents' chambers and that she still thinks she's better than anyone else  perhaps she even thinks that she will need the support of the northern lords if she wishes to seize the North for herself, even if she tries not to think of it. Disturbed at her younger sister's homicidal streak and hurt by the accusations, Sansa tells Arya that she has ""work to do.""
",1
"Much later, Arya stalks Petyr Baelish as he is walking through the grounds of Winterfell. She follows Petyr into his personal quarters and catches him chatting with Maester Wolkan. She eavesdrops on Petyr asking Wolkan if he is sure that ""this"" is the only copy. Petyr replies that Lady Sansa Stark thanks him for his services. After Petyr and Wolkan have left, Arya enters Petyr's chamber and rummages through his study and furniture. While searching through his mattress, she finds a scroll written by Sansa. This turns out to be the scroll that Sansa wrote to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Arya, unaware that Sansa had written the letter under duress from Cersei in an attempt to save their father Eddard Stark, looks horrified. Arya scrunches up the letter and sneaks out of the room, oblivious to a grinning Littlefinger watching from behind a wall.

"At the Citadel, a conclave of Maesters read Bran Stark's message warning of the Army of the Dead but are dismissive of his account. Samwell Tarly, present only to swap out some books, vouches for Bran and tells the Maesters that Bran spent several years surviving in the wilds alone. One Maester mockingly tells Samwell to practice with inscribing instead of entertaining myths and fables. Sam counters that they should use their position as Maesters to warn the people to prepare for the coming Night. Archmaester Ebrose opines that Bran's message could be genuine, but could be disinformation spread by Queen Daenerys. The Maesters agree to send a letter to Winterfell to investigate Bran's claims further, but as they regard the White Walkers as legendary beings akin to the Children of the Forest and the Drowned God, they clearly want to believe Ebrose's misinformation theory. While they agree to investigate Bran's message in further detail, they are skeptical of his claims. After Sam leaves, one of the other Archmaesters asks if it's true that Sam's father and brother were recently burned alive. Ebrose confirms this, and admits that he hasn't had the heart to tell Sam yet.

"Later that night, Gilly reads High Septon Maynard's diary. Gilly tells Samwell the High Septon issued an annulment for ""Prince Ragger"" so that he could marry another woman in Dorne. This new marriage indicates that any children Rhaegar may have with this new wife (presumably Lyanna Stark) are his trueborn children and not bastards. The enormity of the discovery is lost on both of them, with Gilly ignorant of Robert's Rebellion and Samwell being preoccupied with his own misery.

Samwell voices his frustration to Gilly.,1
"Samwell complains about having to inscribe the bodily functions of High Septon Maynard. In exasperation with his situation, Samwell stalks out of the room and goes to the library. He grabs several books and other items. After a contemplative look at the atrium of the room, he meets Gilly in the courtyard of the Citadel where she and Sam wait for him in a wagon. When Gilly asks if he is sure whether he wants to give up his studies, Samwell replies that he is ""tired of reading about the achievements of better men"", quoting his father. They ride off into the night.

Drogon allows Jon to pet him.,1
"The King in the North Jon Snow is walking on the grounds of Dragonstone island when the Dragon Queen Daenerys Targaryen arrives on the back of her dragon Drogon. Drogon roars at Jon at first and stretches out his head to face the King in the North. Drogon calms down and recognizes Jon as a friend of his master (and possibly sensing his Targaryen ancestry), allowing him to stroke his snout, much to Dany's surprise. When Jon Snow (under slight duress) replies that the dragons are beautiful beasts, Dany responds that the dragons are her children. When Jon Snow observes that she was not gone for long, Daenerys curtly replies that she has fewer enemies to deal with.

"Daenerys then asks Jon about the Battle of the Bastards and him ""taking a knife in the heart for his people"". Without going into detail, Jon replies that Davos Seaworth likes to embellish things. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of a recently-healed Jorah Mormont. Daenerys introduces Jorah to Jon, who says he worked under Jorah's father in the Night's Watch. When Jorah reaffirms his allegiance to her, she accepts his offer of service and hugs him.

Varys compares Daenerys to Aerys.,1
"Later, Tyrion and Varys talk about the deaths of Randyll and his son Dickon in the Reach. Varys tells Tyrion about how he distanced himself from the Mad King's role in killing Rickard Stark and his son Brandon Stark. Tyrion continues to insist that Daenerys is not her father, and Varys agrees up to a point: Dany may not have her father's madness, but she certainly has a growing ruthless streak, which in Varys' view must be curtailed by Tyrion's more pragmatic counsel. They discuss a sealed scroll containing Bran Stark's message from the North  which Varys of course, read.
",1
"Later, at the Chamber of the Painted Table, Jon tells Daenerys about the news of his half-brother Bran and half-sister Arya Stark's return to Winterfell. He wants to go home to Winterfell, concerned by Bran's vision which warns the Army of the Dead are getting closer and Jon is worried the undead army will make it past the Wall and advance on the North. Dany notes that Jon doesn't have enough men to fight the Army of the Dead and Jon asks her again to join him. However, Dany is worried that Cersei will take advantage and march in if she turns her focus to the Army of the Dead. Tyrion is present and proposes bringing a wight south to King's Landing in order to prove that the Army of the Dead is real and convince Queen Cersei Lannister, so they can come to a truce. Varys opines that it is suicide trying to appeal to Cersei but Tyrion argues that he can persuade his brother Jaime.

Davos and Jon prepare to depart to Eastwatch.,1
"Davos, as the only one who might be able to smuggle Tyrion into King's Landing, reluctantly agrees, but also thinks such a mission is risky even for a smuggler like him. Jorah volunteers to go north to help capture a Wight while Jon volunteers to lead the expedition, since the Free Folk won't follow Jorah and he is the only one who has the most experience facing their enemy. Apparently on the verge of tears about the idea of Jon leaving, Daenerys responds that she did not give Jon permission to leave but Jon reminds her that he is the King in the North. He tells her she has the power of life and death over him but that he trusted her even though she was a stranger. He pleads with her to return the favor by trusting him. Later, Davos and Tyrion chat about smuggling before embarking on their mission to infiltrate King's Landing. Davos plans to find Gendry while Tyrion wants to secretly meet with Jaime to find a peaceful solution to the war.

Daenerys bid farewell to Jorah.,1
"Davos and Tyrion return with Gendry to Dragonstone. At the dragonglass mines, they meet Jon Snow, who is supervising the diggings and excavations. Gendry remarks that Jon is a lot shorter than he expected  and immediately blurts out his true parentage, on the assumption that Jon will value honesty and will appreciate the idea of Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon's bastards joining forces. Gendry volunteers to accompany Jon on his mission to the North to capture a wight and convince Queen Daenerys and Queen Cersei that the true war lies to the North. As Jon Snow and his party, including Jorah Mormont prepare to depart on boats for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Dany and her entourage arrive to bid them farewell. Dany quips to Jorah that they should be used to saying farewell to each other. Jon arrives at the beach as they are saying goodbye. Jon playfully quips to Daenerys that if their mission is unsuccessful and he doesnt return she at least wont have to deal with the King in the North anymore. Dany responds that shes ""grown used to him"", hinting that she may have feelings for him. Jon wishes her good fortune in the wars to come before he leaves. Dany and Tyrion watch as Jon Snow and his party depart on their boats for Eastwatch.

Jaime returns to King's Landing.,1
"Jaime returns to King's Landing to inform Cersei of the defeat. He flatly insists that the Lannisters have no chance of defeating Daenerys, even if Cersei were able to buy enough mercenaries to replace their huge losses; Qyburn's scorpion did little more than anger Drogon, and neither the Lannister soldiers nor any mercenaries will be able to match the huge horde of Dothraki, who Jaime notes killed their men as if it were sport to them, not war. Cersei snidely asks Jaime if they are expected to surrender to a Queen whose throne Cersei occupies and whose father Jaime betrayed and murdered, mockingly remarking that Tyrion could intercede for them with Daenerys.
",1
Cersei is told of Olenna's role in Joffrey's murder.,1
"Jaime reveals to Cersei that Tyrion is innocent of Joffrey's murder, telling her Olenna Tyrell confessed to it. Cersei is dismissive of Tyrion's innocence in all things as usual, so Jaime has to talk her through it, asking her rhetorically if Olenna would prefer Margaery to marry the strong-willed and sadistic Joffrey or the emotionally pliable and good-natured Tommen. Effectively, Olenna would have become the true ruler of the Seven kingdoms behind the scenes - in the same way that their father Tywin Lannister became the true ruler of Westeros through his grandsons. Feeling cheated of yet another vengeance, Cersei can barely contain her fury as she laments listening to Jaime, saying Olenna ought to have died screaming. Jaime says she's dead, nonetheless, along with the rest of House Tyrell, and that they will go the same way unless they are careful. Jaime sees no other path to victory; Tyrion now stands against his own siblings with a foreign invader possessed of a large, fearsome army and three ferocious dragons. Cersei dismisses his protests, however, making it plain she intends to fight to the death rather than surrender her throne, and expects the same from Jaime and the rest of the Lannister military.

Tyrion reunites with Jaime.,1
"Later, beneath the Red Keep, Bronn leads Jaime to a sparring session amongst the skulls of the Targaryen dragons, only to discover it is a secret meeting with his estranged brother Tyrion. Jaime is initially angry that Bronn has arranged the secret meeting. Tyrion jokes about Jaime abandoning the Lannister seat of Casterly Rock while Jaime wishes him dead for killing their father Tywin. Snapping, an emotional Tyrion points out that their father knew he was innocent but still condemned him to death nonetheless, having hated him all his life for being born a dwarf. When Jaime demands to know what Tyrion wants, the dwarf responds that Jaime knows that Daenerys will win the war and tells him that Daenerys is willing to make peace with Cersei under certain conditions. He tells Jaime about Daenerys's terms.

Gendry is found.,1
"Meanwhile, Davos visits Flea Bottom and eventually finds Gendry in a smithy on the Street of Steel. Joking that he thought Gendry might still be rowing by then, Gendry confirms that no has given him a second glance and realizes that Davos has come to bring him for something important. Having never been happy with serving the family who murdered his father and tried to kill him, Gendry explains that he's been preparing for such a moment and readily agrees to come with him. When Davos warns it will be dangerous and that he should take one of the swords in the shop, Gendry points out he was never taught to fight properly and is only good with a hammer... retrieving from the back of the shop a war hammer, a maul with a stag's head design on either side of the haft socket (likely forged himself and referencing his Baratheon roots).
",1
"Later on the shores of Blackwater Bay, Davos and Gendry, having placed his hammer in Davos' boat, prepare to leave but are spotted by a pair of Gold Cloaks. Davos pretends to be a common smuggler and bribes the guards with coin. He strikes up a conversation with the guards and on being asked about his cargo, he shows them he is transporting fermented crab, an aphrodisiac that is popular with the city's brothels. He uncovers the crab while pulling the cloth aside to hide the war hammer and gives each guard a sample. The guards are satisfied, if slightly disgusted, with Davos's explanation and bribe and prepare to depart, but Tyrion arrives at that exact moment; realizing it's too late to turn back and not look suspicious, Tyrion walks past them to the boat while looking downward. However, one of the guards recognizes Tyrion by his scar and asks him to stop. They realize that he is indeed Tyrion Lannister, and immediately see through Davos' deception. With their backs to Gendry and the boat and before they can react, he kills them both by smashing their skulls in with his hammer. Davos, slightly exasperated, introduces Gendry to Tyrion, who wryly observes ""he'll do"".

Cersei reveals she is pregnant.,1
"Later, at the Red Keep, Qyburn is visiting Cersei when Jaime enters her chambers. Jaime tells Cersei that he met with Tyrion. When Cersei asks if Daenerys wants to negotiate a surrender, Jaime tells her that Dany is seeking an armistice due to the threat posed by the Army of the Dead. Cersei knows that Bronn secretly organized the meeting between Tyrion and Jaime. Cersei says that perhaps an alliance with Daenerys may be a wiser move, but she still retains her determination to destroy any force that stands against her. She also asks if Jaime plans to punish Bronn for arranging the clandestine meeting with Tyrion. She also reveals that she is pregnant with another of Jaime's children, one who she believes will someday be the heir to the Iron Throne. After reflecting on their late father's advice that ""the lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep"", Cersei hugs Jaime and whispers in his ear that he is never to betray her again.

"After landing at Eastwatch, they meet with the Wildling Tormund who thinks that Jon's plan will lead to their deaths. Tormund asks about having to convince two Queens. Davos volunteers to stay behind at Eastwatch because he regards himself as a liability, given his age and relative lack of fighting ability. They later learn that the Night's Watch has detained members of the Brotherhood Without Banners including Beric Dondarrion, Thoros and Sandor Clegane. Jon and his team meet with the prisoners in the icy cells beneath Eastwatch, where the entire group swiftly establishes their reasons for hating each other. Gendry opines that they should not trust Thoros because the Brotherhood sold him to the Red Witch, raising Davos and Jon's hackles. Thoros, in turn, is surprised to see Jorah, an old comrade and rival from the Siege of Pyke.

The Wight Hunt begins.,1
"While the Wildlings, Mormont, and the Brotherhood Without Banners distrust each other, they decide to put aside their differences to fight against the Army of the Dead. Sandor quips that the cells are freezing. After they are freed, Jon, Jorah, Tormund, Gendry, Sandor, Beric, and Thoros exit Eastwatch's gate and set out into the lands beyond the Wall on their dangerous mission to capture a Wight to bring to Daenerys and Cersei.

"Jon and the Brotherhood hunt the dead. Arya confronts Sansa. Tyrion thinks about the future. 
",1
Sansa confronts Arya on her behaviour.,1
"At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death.
",1
"Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay.
",1
"Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear.
",1
"Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice.
",1
Sansa sends Brienne south to Parley with Cersei.,1
"The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.
",1
"Following the events of the Wight Hunt, Sansa enters Arya's quarters and opens a leather case containing several ""faces"", including the literally late Walder Frey's face. Arya catches her sister pilfering through her personal effects. When Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her, Arya mockingly retorts that they are not here. Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the ""faces"" are.
",1
Sansa learns about the Faceless Men.,1
"Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger.

Tyrion and Daenerys discuss a possible armistice.,1
"At Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to ""heroes"" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom ""do stupid things, trying to outdo the others"". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her  to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward. The two then turn their attention to the topic of their impending meeting with Queen Cersei in King's Landing. Tyrion admits that Cersei cannot be trusted and could be setting a trap for them, but that Daenerys will have the Unsullied, the Dothraki and her dragons at hand; if anyone tries to harm her, King's Landing will be leveled in response.
",1
"Daenerys wonders whether, given that Cersei will almost certainly be attempting to double-cross them, they should be planning something similar. Tyrion is firmly against any deceit, counseling Daenerys that while she needs a healthy degree of fear to instill respect, she cannot rule through fear alone, as leaders who rule through fear alone like Cersei, Tywin, and Joffrey are hated by their people and forever vulnerable to being overthrown. Tyrion reminds Daenerys about her vision of creating a new society by ""breaking the wheel"" rather than merely imitating prior rulers like Aegon Targaryen, and cautions her about her temper and impulsiveness, citing the fiery executions of Lord Randyll Tarly and his son Dickon. Daenerys asserts that such an action was necessary, but Tyrion still believes she should have attempted more merciful means of dealing with the problem the Tarlys posed, or at least left them alive long enough to consider her other options rather than having them summarily executed. As Daenerys becomes increasingly agitated in the face of Tyrion's blunt but reasonable remarks, he reassures Daenerys that he supports her vision and ideals. Tyrion also proposes that Daenerys consider a succession plan in the event of a disaster, given that by her own admission, she believes she is incapable of bearing children. She refuses to consider this plan until she has donned the crown, also coldly blaming Tyrion's policy of caution for causing her the loss of Highgarden, Ellaria Sand, and Yara Greyjoy.

Tormund and Jon compare wildlings and northmen.,1
"Jon Snow and his ranging party travel through the lands beyond the wall on their mission to capture a wight. Gendry complains about the bitter cold and asks Tormund about life as a Wildling. Tormund later confides with Jon about the foolhardy nature of their mission, while Jon discusses his difficult negotiations with Daenerys. Tormund points out that the pride of the Northmen may cost them too many lives, citing Mance Rayder and the Wildlings as an example. While walking, Gendry also confronts the Brotherhood Without Banners about selling him off as a sacrifice to Melisandre. Sandor Clegane sneers that Gendry should be grateful that he is still alive and points out that Beric Dondarrion has been killed six times (not mentioning one of those was by Sandor himself) ""and you don't hear him  bitching about it"". Not entirely sure what to think of that particular revelation, Gendry accepts a drink from Thoros's wineskin.
",1
"While walking, Jon and Jorah Mormont also chat about their relationships with their fathers Eddard Stark and Jeor Mormont respectively. They say that their fathers were good and honorable men and did not deserve their deaths. Jon tells Jorah about the brutal death of Jeor at the hands of the Mutineers and that Eddard was beheaded. Jon tries to return to Jorah his father's Valyrian sword Longclaw but Jorah tells him that he is not worthy to bear his father's sword, having forfeited any claim to it when he brought shame into his House. His father gave the sword to Jon, and gives his blessing for Jon and his future children to keep it.
",1
"Later, Sandor and Tormund trade jabs about sex. Sandor takes offense when Tormund asks about how he burnt his face. Tormund then confides in Sandor about his infatuation for Brienne of Tarth, who is nearly as tall as Sandor. He jokes about having ""monstrous"" babies with her, to Sandor's utter bewilderment. Beric and Jon talk about Eddard Stark and how they have both been resurrected by worshipers of the Lord of Light. Beric tells Jon that he is fighting for life because death is the first and last enemy; it is inevitable, but it is human nature to fight it for as long as you can. He warns Jon that they have to work together to fight death and defend those who cannot defend themselves. Jon reflects on his Night's Watch oath about being the ""shield that guards the realms of men"" and agrees. Sandor sees the mountain from his vision lying ahead and steers the group in that direction.
",1
"While trudging through a snowstorm, Jon and his party sight a massive snow bear with blue eyes approaching them. The snow bear turns out to have been resurrected by a White Walker. The monstrous creature mauls and kills three of their company. Beric and Thoros manage to set the snow bear alight with his flaming sword but it continues to attack, forcing Thoros to get in its' way when it attacks Sandor, who is too terrified of the flames engulfing the beast even to defend himself. Thoros is unable to break free of its jaws until Jorah kills it with a dragonglass dagger. Beric cauterizes Thoros' wounds with his flaming sword.
",1
"Jorah asks the wounded Thoros about his experience charging with a flaming sword during the Siege of Pyke, and commends his old comrade for his drunken bravery. While navigating through the mountain, they see a White Walker leading a column of Wights marching through the canyon below. The ranging party plants a fire and then ambushes them when the White Walker stops to investigate. Jon manages to kill the White Walker with Longclaw, causing most of the Wights associated with it to disintegrate, while the rest of the group manages to capture the only unaffected wight. The creature unexpectedly screeches for help; Sandor slaps his gloved hand over its mouth, but it wrenches its face away when its mouth skin tears off into the glove, to Sandor and Jorah's disgust. As Jorah pulls out a bag from his jacket and secures it over its head, Sandor and Tormund bind the creature with a coil of rope. In the middle of this, they realize their captive's howls have drawn the attention of a massive host of wights now heading their way, hastening their work.
",1
"As the noise of the horde approaches, Jon sends Gendry, over his protest, back to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to bring news to Daenerys as he's the fastest. Gendry gives his war hammer to Tormund, who hands it to Sandor who has the wight slung over his shoulder. The wights pursue the group over a lake of weak ice, as they flee toward a large stone island jutting out in the middle. One of the party trips and falls behind; a few of the horde tackles him, the combined weight breaks the ice, and they fall through. This causes a chain reaction of breaking ice all around the rock until the horde slows to a stop to avoid the water. Throughout the night, Jon and his comrades wait in the middle of the ice while encircled by the army of the undead. Meanwhile, Gendry reaches Eastwatch's outer gates but collapses from exhaustion. Davos Seaworth and several guards attend to him. When Davos asks what happened, Gendry tells him to prepare a raven; Davos orders to bring the Maester.
",1
"In the morning, Jon and his company awake to find that Thoros has died from his wounds. Beric and Sandor pay their last respects, with the former praying for the Lord of Light to guard them as the latter assures him freezing to death is said to be one of the better ways to die. At Jon's insistence, they burn the body with Beric's flaming sword so Thoros can't be reanimated. The wights watch while their captive Wight struggles under its hood and restraints. Jorah proposes killing the wight but Jon counters that they need to keep it as evidence. Beric suggests that Jon kill the Night King, who has just arrived on horseback; given that they've seen killing a Walker destroyed the wights it controlled, killing the Night King might destroy them all. He then adds that the Lord of Light has not resurrected Jon for no reason, but Sandor reminds him that they have just lost their priest, and Beric is now down to his last life.
",1
Daenerys prepares to leave for Eastwatch.,1
"After receiving Gendry's message from Eastwatch, Tyrion implores Queen Daenerys, who has donned a cold-weather version of her Targaryen garb, not to leave for the North because it is too risky, insisting that Jon and his companions knew the risks of their mission and that if Daenerys dies beyond the Wall, everything they've done will be for nothing. Daenerys counters that he told her to do nothing before and she lost. Dissatisfied with his advice, Dany leaves with all three dragons to the lands beyond the Wall to aid Jon Snow and his ranging party.
",1
The Army of the Dead attack the living.,1
"Bored, Sandor hurls two rocks at one of the undead minions, knocking its jaw off. The second however, skids across the ice, and both the party and the undead quickly realize the ice, which has hardened overnight, is strong enough to support their weight, and in ever-increasing numbers, the horde attacks the group's position. Sandor holds them back with Gendry's hammer while Jon and the other members of the ranging party join in, wielding weapons of fire, dragonglass or Valyrian steel. Beric manages to set several of the wights alight with his flaming sword. The ranging party hack and slash at the wights with their blades but are unable to stem the tide. With the group overwhelmed, Jon orders them to fall back to the highest part of the island. Tormund is overwhelmed by several wights and is nearly dragged under the ice, but is saved by Sandor, who drags him back onto the island. The group continues fighting against the wights. One of the Wildlings falls off a ledge and is ripped apart by the creatures, who begin to scramble up the ledge towards the living.
",1
"When all seems lost, Queen Daenerys arrives with her dragons, who attack the wights with dragonfire. Hundreds of wights are burned to ashes while others collapse under the ice, which is melted by dragonfire. Jon and his party rush to Daenerys and her dragon Drogon, dragging their captive wight with them, while Viserion and Rhaegal provide covering fire from above. Meanwhile, the Night King obtains an icy javelin from one of his lieutenants and hurls it at Viserion, scoring a direct hit. Viserion is struck in the neck and plunges helplessly into freefall, shrieking in agony as blood and fire pour from the fatal wound. Drogon and Rhaegal cry out for their brother, but are powerless to help him as Daenerys watches in horror and sorrow. Viserion crashes onto the frozen lake, shattering the ice, and slowly sinks beneath it.
",1
Benjen saves Jon from death.,1
"As the Night King readies another spear, Jon hollers at Daenerys and company to leave with her remaining dragons before being dragged under the ice by two wights. Daenerys and the survivors of Jon's ranging expedition flee with Drogon and Rhaegal before the Night King can kill them. He hurls the second javelin, but Drogon narrowly dodges it. With the dragons gone, the Night King and his army leave the scene. Later, Jon Snow climbs out of the ice and regains Longclaw. Jon is quickly spotted and pursued by a large horde. Before the wights can finish the King in the North, his long-lost uncle Benjen Stark appears on horseback with his flaming flail. Benjen tells Jon to flee on his horse while he stays behind to buy time for Jon to escape. While riding away on horseback, Jon watches his uncle being overwhelmed by the undead.
",1
"At Eastwatch, Sandor carries the struggling Wight into a boat. Tormund and Beric tell him they will meet again but Sandor retorts he hopes not. Daenerys sends Drogon and Rhaegal to scour the surrounding mountains for Jon. Jorah tells Daenerys that it is time to leave but she insists on waiting a bit longer. Before she can leave, they hear a horn blowing signalling a rider approaching. Looking down from the battlements, Dany sees a wounded Jon Snow approaching on horseback. Aboard their ship, Davos and Gendry tend to Jon Snow, who has suffered severe hypothermia and several minor injuries. Daenerys also notes the massive scars on his chest from his previous fatal wounds.
",1
"In the Narrow Sea, Jon Snow wakes to find Daenerys watching over him in his chambers. Jon apologizes for the disastrous ranging party and the fact it caused Viserion's death, but Daenerys tells him not to apologize because she now knows that the Army of the Dead is real. Overcome with emotion, she tells Jon that the dragons are the only children she will ever have, and vows that she and Jon will together destroy the Night King. Jon thanks her for her support, addressing her as ""Dany"", and Daenerys realizes that the last person to address her by that name was her older brother Viserys Targaryen, who Daenerys remembers as not being a good person. Jon apologizes and asks if ""My Queen"" would be more appropriate; realizing he is agreeing to bend the knee, Daenerys asks Jon what the Northern lords loyal to him will make of this. Jon assures her they will come to see her for the good person she is, as he already has. Touched by his statement, Daenerys gently takes Jon's hand in her own for a moment. They gaze into each other's eye for a moment  a long moment  but Daenerys suddenly pulls away and tells him to get some rest and leaves him alone.
",1
"Later, hundreds of Wights use several large chains to drag Viserion's corpse out of the frozen lake as the Night King and one of his lieutenants watch. When the dragon's corpse is dragged far enough out of the lake, the Night King walks over and places his hand upon Viserion's snout. All is quiet for a moment... and then Viserion's eyes snap open, shining a depthless, icy blue.

Bronn and Jaime discuss Daenerys's forces.,1
"The Unsullied, led by a grim-faced Grey Worm, line up in tight formation outside the walls of King's Landing. On the walls, Jaime Lannister and Bronn discuss how the latter is unnerved by the idea of soldiers without genitalia, as he's been around enough soldiers to know why they fight, and that the idea of soldiers who fight for no promise of sex is alien to him. As they talk, hordes of Dothraki ride in, a stark contrast to the disciplined Unsullied who don't even blink as hundreds of horses flood past them; but the two ancient enemies are united in cause today.

"At the harbor, Tyrion Lannister, Varys, Missandei, Jon Snow and Davos Seaworth nervously sail past Euron Greyjoy's fleet. Sandor Clegane goes below decks to check on their ""guest,"" who is thankfully just as riled up as ever. In her solar, Cersei is informed by Qyburn of the arrival of Daenerys's party, though there is no sign of her. Cersei promptly tells Gregor Clegane that if anything goes wrong at the summit, he is to kill Daenerys, Tyrion and Jon in that order, then dispose of the rest as he pleases.
",1
"The group arrives and are escorted to the Dragonpit, the location of the summit. Tyrion reconnects with Bronn, who concedes it is good to see him again. The pair greet Podrick Payne, who had arrived earlier with Brienne of Tarth. As Pod goes off with Bronn, Brienne hangs back to talk with Sandor. They both acknowledge that they only fought to protect Arya, and she tells him that Arya doesn't need looking out for anymore; rather, he should reserve his concern for whoever is unfortunate or stupid enough to stand in her way, which seems to amuse him.
",1
"At the Dragonpit, the various factions meet: Cersei Lannister, Jaime, Qyburn and Euron representing the Iron Throne, Jon, Davos and Brienne representing the North, and Daenerys's court. When Cersei demands to know where her rival is, the Dragon Queen makes a suitably dramatic entrance on Drogon's back, with Rhaegal flying overhead. Sandor, for the first time in years, comes face-to-helmet with his brother Gregor, and wonders what exactly has happened to him, before leaving to retrieve the captured wight. Sandor ultimately muses however that what happened to Gregor is irrelevant, and promises what's left of his brother that he still intends to end Gregor. Euron tries to posture, threatening to kill Yara unless Theon yields to him and deriding Tyrion's dwarfism; when Tyrion and Theon retort to his taunts with their own, Euron remarks that Tyrion would have been killed at birth in the Iron Islands. A furious Jaime orders Euron to sit down, and when he disregards the warning, Cersei reiterates it; a subdued Euron returns to his seat.

Jon and Tyrion explain the Great War.,1
"Getting the meeting on track, Tyrion and Jon attempt to convince the Lannister queen of the greater threat coming for them all; according to Tyrion, one million people all live crammed together in the city. They will soon become one million more soldiers in the army of the dead. Cersei callously responds that it will likely be an improvement for most of them, her flippancy noticeably angering the normally stoic Jon. Cersei refuses to believe the claims, dismissing this as a ploy to trick her into lowering her defenses. To prove their claims, Sandor returns with the crate containing the wight, which is worryingly silent. Sandor gets the crate open and is visibly frightened by what he sees inside it, which worries Jaime since he knows the Hound is not afraid of anything, while Cersei watches the proceedings with a dismissively smug smirk. Sandor finally gives the crate a massive kick and knocks it over; the enraged wight promptly clambers out and charges toward the nearest target - Cersei, appropriately enough. Completely stunned at the sight of the undead creature throwing itself towards them, the Lannister queen and her allies recoil in horror as Sandor pulls the screeching monster back on a chain, its claws inches from Cersei's face, and manages to slice the creature in half when it turns to attack him. The Stark and Targaryen delegations watch it emotionlessly but the Lannisters look on in shock as the wight's upper half still moves around shrieking and snarling, trying to crawl towards Sandor, who slices off one of its outstretched hands. After a clearly fascinated Qyburn briefly examines it, Jon steps forward and takes the wight's severed hand, using a torch provided by Davos to demonstrate how fire can be used to stop them. He then uses a dragonglass dagger to the heart to end the wight's upper half, bluntly stating that if they don't win the coming war, such a fate awaits every person in Westeros, insisting that all their other conflicts pale in comparison to the Great War. Daenerys, who has watched the whole thing poker-faced, supplies that she didn't believe it herself until she saw them all personally. A horror-struck Jaime asks how many wights are coming, and Daenerys tells him the army of the dead numbers at least 100,000. Euron asks if the wights can swim. When Jon responds, ""No,"" Euron announces to Cersei his intention to withdraw the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Isles. He declares that he has been over the whole world and has never been terrified until now. On his way out, he tells Daenerys to retreat to her island while he returns to his own, and to come find him when they are the only two left alive.
",1
"Seemingly convinced, Cersei immediately offers terms: satisfied that Daenerys is concerned with the Army of the Dead, Cersei will not withdraw her troops, but will guarantee that they will not hinder the Targaryen or Northern forces in any way during the battle against the White Walkers. She refuses to deal with Daenerys at all, however, and calls on Jon Snow, as King in the North and Ned Stark's son, to keep the truce and to stay out of any future conflict between Cersei and Daenerys. Jon, however, says that he cannot serve two queens - and reveals to all assembled that he has already declared for Daenerys, infuriating all three Lannisters present. Declaring that there will be no truce if it is just her and Daenerys, Cersei storms out, content to let the Starks and Targaryens battle the undead alone and then deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict. Desperate, Brienne grabs Jaime and begs him to reconsider, as what they've seen goes beyond such petty reasons as Houses, honor and thrones. Jaime doesn't disagree, but walks away, not knowing what he can say to convince his sister.
",1
"Meanwhile, Daenerys and Tyrion (who never knew about Jon's change of heart in the first place) criticize Jon over declaring his allegiance in public. Tyrion suggests that learning to lie just a little might be a good skill, while Daenerys points out that if they leave without an alliance, everything they've sacrificed, including Viserion's death, will be made worthless. Jon responds that while such an attitude may or may not have contributed to getting his father killed, if no one is willing to speak the truth, then everyone's word is worthless, and lies will not help them win the coming fight. Tyrion reluctantly decides that he will go and try to talk some reason into Cersei alone. Daenerys and Jon protest, fearing Cersei may have him killed out of spite, but Tyrion insists it's the only way if they don't want everything they've done to be for nothing and bids them wait.
",1
"In the Red Keep, Tyrion, escorted by Ser Gregor, meets Jaime, who confirms that he believes the threat of the Dead, but has been unable to convince Cersei. He only accomplished talking at her until she threw him out of her office. Tyrion enters Cersei's office, and the two trade savage barbs, Cersei blames his murder of Tywin for the series of events that led to her younger children's deaths and the destruction of House Lannister's future. Tyrion maintains that Tywin deserved to die for both the years of abuse he inflicted on Tyrion and for trying to execute Tyrion on false charges, as well as insisting he loved Myrcella Baratheon and Tommen Baratheon almost as much as Cersei and that he regrets what happened to them. He attempts to call Cersei's bluff, claiming that if Cersei genuinely blamed him for their deaths, then Gregor should just kill him right then and there. A tense moment passes but Cersei refrains from giving the order. Relieved, Tyrion heads straight for the wine. They continue their discussion; Cersei angrily accuses Tyrion of plotting to bring down House Lannister with the help of Jon and Daenerys. Tyrion loses patience, retorting that he didn't know Jon had sworn allegiance to Daenerys and that without his intervention, Daenerys would have razed the Red Keep to the ground with everyone inside it. When Cersei questions why Tyrion stopped her, he replies that he believes she will make the world a better place, and that he serves Daenerys to curb her excesses, unlike Cersei. She retorts that her only interest is protecting those she cares about, at which Tyrion realizes that Cersei is pregnant.

Daenerys and Jon discuss Viserion's death.,1
"Back at the Dragonpit, Daenerys and Jon discuss the dragons and how her ancestors caged them, and in turn become less impressive as the power of the dragons waned. Jon questions Daenerys's assertion of infertility, particularly when she admits that she never got an informed opinion about her condition from anyone except Mirri Maz Duur herself. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of all three Lannisters. Cersei has agreed to work with Daenerys, but not by keeping her troops back: the Lannister army will march north to fight alongside the Starks and Targaryens.
",1
Cersei reveals her intentions to Jaime.,1
"After the enemy delegation has left, an eager and relieved Jaime meets with his commanders to discuss the logistics of moving the army north. Cersei enters the map room and asks what he is doing. Dismissing the commanders, she tells Jaime he really is the stupidest Lannister. Shocked, Jaime listens as Cersei explains that Euron has not abandoned her, but has gone to Essos to ferry the Golden Company back to Westeros. She intentionally leaked her pregnancy to Tyrion so he would believe her, and now she intends to allow their enemies to exhaust themselves against the Army of the Dead, then have the Golden Company clean up what's left of whoever wins in the North. Jaime is furious that his sister and Euron plotted this behind his back, but Cersei angrily accuses him of plotting with Tyrion in favor of her enemies. Reeling from the accusation, Jaime incredulously reminds her that someone is going to win the battle in the North regardless and come south afterwards; if the dead win, their numbers will be strengthened by the casualties and they will kill all without pause, compunction or mercy. If the living win, the realm will know Cersei left them all to die and will march south to settle the score but Cersei is indifferent. Finally seeing his sister for the power-mad narcissist she truly is, Olenna Tyrell's warnings ringing in his ears, Jaime disgustedly declares that he, at least, will fight to honor the pledge he made. When he tries to leave, he finds his way blocked by Ser Gregor. Cersei furiously insists that she will kill him as a traitor if he tries to leave, but Jaime calls her bluff and storms out, and Cersei does not give the order.

"Alone, Jaime rides out of King's Landing, having discarded his Lannister armour in favour of rougher and less recognisable travelling garb. Realizing how conspicuous he is, he nervously pulls a glove over his golden hand. Surprised by the sudden appearance of a drop of water on the glove, Jaime looks up and sees snow begin to fall from the grey sky, carried by a chill wind. As Jaime rides away, the snow begins to cover King's Landing in its entirety; the streets, the houses, the ruins where the Great Sept once stood, the little skulls in the Dragonpit and even Cersei's map in the Red Keep.

Seemingly overcome with horror at the thought that Arya would want to take her place and reign as Lady of Winterfell, it seems that Sansa decides to do something about it, to Baelish's quiet delight.

The Starks stage Littlefinger's trial.,1
"After a long time reflecting on her course of action on the battlements, Sansa orders Arya be brought to the great hall. In the Hall, Sansa and Bran are seated at the great table, the hall lined with Stark and Arryn men and a few key lords such as Yohn Royce and, of course, Baelish who is watching the whole thing with a malicious little smile. Arya is brought in and asks Sansa if she ""really wants to do this."" Sansa replies it's not about what she wants, it's about justice. She proceeds to rattle off a list of crimes perpetrated against House Stark... and asks Baelish how he intends to answer the charges. At this, all eyes turn towards Baelish. Thrown, Littlefinger tries to figure out what is going on. Sansa reveals his murder of Lysa Arryn and his use of Lysa to murder Jon Arryn. She uses his own words against him and accuses him (quite correctly) of orchestrating the conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters that has ultimately engulfed the Seven Kingdoms for the better part of the last decade, including the betrayal and death of her father Eddard Stark.

"Arya makes another step avenging her family, killing Littlefinger.",1
"Baelish tries to deny this, but Bran uses his Greensight to recall the exact words Baelish said as he held the knife to Ned's throat. Swiftly realizing that he has lost control of the situation and the trial is just a drumhead, Baelish demands that Lord Royce take him, the Lord Protector of the Vale, to safety; Bronze Yohn refuses him with the words ""I think not"". In desperation, Baelish falls to his knees and pleads for his life, insisting yet again how much he loved Cat and how much he now loves Sansa, but Sansa, unswayed by his pleadings, sentences him to death and promises she will never forget all the lessons he taught her. As Baelish tries to speak, Arya slits his throat with the same Valyrian steel dagger that lay at the heart of his plots. Littlefinger slumps dead to the floor, the Northern and Vale men and women watching dispassionately. At long last, the War of the Five Kings is ended and justice meted out on the one responsbible.

"On the battlements, Sansa and Arya discuss Littlefinger's plots and how much they, as people, have changed. Arya tells Sansa that she wouldn't have been able to survive what Sansa did. Sansa disagrees, saying Arya is the strongest person she knows. The sisters muse on another of their father's sayings about how lone wolves die in the winter, but wolf packs survive. They realize the truth of his words as their remaining family needs to stick together.

Bran's vision of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.,1
"Sometime later, Samwell Tarly and Gilly arrive at Winterfell. Upon hearing that Bran is back, Sam calls on him, recalling their meeting at the Nightfort some years earlier. Bran is glad to see Sam, but is surprised to find him here. When Sam reiterates his loyalty to Jon, Bran, unable to keep it a secret any longer, reveals the truth of Jon's origins: he was born to Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark at a Tower in Dorne, and is not a Snow at all, but a Sand. Sam realizes that that isn't true either, recalling the entry from High Septon Maynard's private journal about annulling Rhaegar's marriage. Bran expressed his doubts, but Sam reiterates the private nature of the journal and encourages Bran to use Greensight to confirm it. To his own surprise, Bran easily finds the wedding, where he sees a clearly happy Lyanna wedding Rhaegar in a Faith of the Seven ceremony before a Heart tree. Warging forward to the Tower of Joy, Bran finally hears Lyanna's dying words. Now piecing the truth together, Bran declares that Rhaegar never raped Lyanna. She loved him and ran off with him, and bore him a son: Aegon Targaryen. His voice breaks a little as he realizes that Robert's Rebellion, the deaths of his grandfather and uncle, and the entire reign of House Baratheon of King's Landing was all for nothing and built on a lie... And his cousin raised as his illegitimate brother is, and always has been, the heir to the Iron Throne.

"In the Chamber of the Painted Table, Daenerys and her court discuss logistics. It will take the Dothraki a fortnight to reach Winterfell, and the plan is to have Jon and the Unsullied cross the sea by ship and meet them at White Harbor. Jorah Mormont points out that the North is not really safer for her than anywhere else, as someone with a memory of Robert's Rebellion and an idea of becoming a hero could easily take her out with a single crossbow bolt. He suggests she fly to Winterfell to avoid any potential unpleasantness. Jon counters that Daenerys ride with them so that the North can see her as a liberator and ally. After a moment's consideration, Daenerys decides to sail to Winterfell with Jon. Jorah, suspecting a different reason for her decision, throws her a look, which she notices but avoids.

"After the meeting, Theon talks privately with Jon. He tells Jon that, even when they were growing up at Winterfell, Jon always seemed to know the right thing to do. Jon explains he has made mistakes and has done things he regrets. Theon replies, ""Not compared to me, you haven't,"" and confides that he has always felt torn between his Greyjoy heritage and his Stark upbringing, tried to do the right thing, but was uncertain about the right step to take. Jon is angry about Theon's betrayal against (Jon's) family and tells him that their father, Ned Stark, was more a father to Theon than Balon Greyjoy ever was. However, Jon relents and tells Theon that he never lost Ned, Ned is part of both of them, and Theon is both a Greyjoy and a Stark. He says he can forgive Theon for what is in his power to forgive. Theon confides that when he was Ramsay's prisoner, his sister Yara tried to save him and he needs to save her now. Jon encourages him to save Yara.

Theon fights for the loyalty of his crew.,1
"Theon returns to the remaining Ironborn who continue to regard him with disgust. Theon tells his men that Euron has his sister and that they must go back for her. Harrag shuts Theon down, declaring him a coward, and proclaims that they are going to go where they can rape and pillage as they usually do. Theon reminds them that Yara has forbidden their old ways, but Harrag threatens Theon and begins to assault him, telling him to stay down. Although he is knocked down, Theon barely reacts to the blows, as he has experienced far greater pain at the hands of Ramsay Bolton. He gets up to attack, but Harrag continues to beat Theon, again insisting he stay or he will kill him. Theon once more defies him, and attacks Harrag who grabs Theon, and kicks him several times in the crotch. However, as Ramsay had previously castrated Theon, there are no testicles for Harrag to injure. Theon smiles as he gets the upper hand, smashing the captain's face practically to a pulp, and beating him into submission. The other ironborn finally relent, accepting Theon and his mission. As they prepare to set sail, Theon wades into the sea to wash his wounds in salt water, embracing his identity as an ironborn.

"Sometime after setting sail, Jon knocks on the door of Daenerys's cabin. She answers and meets his gaze without words. After a moment, he enters, and, with their eyes still locked, shuts the door. Unaware of the truth of Jon's heritage (the fact that they are biologically aunt and nephew), they finally give into the burgeoning passion between them and consummate their relationship.

"Unknown to both of them, Tyrion had also been on his way to speak with his queen, and had seen Jon enter the cabin. Silently concerned at the possible implications of what may occur, Tyrion walks away.

"Tormund and Beric Dondarrion review the defenses atop the Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Tormund remarks that the crows say he'll get used to the height, but he admits it'll probably be a while. Suddenly, the pair sees movement at the edge of the Haunted Forest. A White Walker emerges atop an undead horse, followed shortly by a horde of wights. More and more White Walkers emerge as the Night Watch's horns sound three times. However, the Army of the Dead stops some distance from the foot of the Wall and Tormund looks relieved; despite their numbers, the dead don't have anything that could possibly get them past the huge Wall. But then all on the Wall stop in horror as they hear a very familiar sound; a screeching roar mixed with the heavy thumping of huge wings beating the air.

"Suddenly, the undead Viserion swoops down, with the Night King riding on his back. In a burst of bright blue flame, Viserion demolishes some of the scouting platforms atop the Wall and then turns his flames against the Wall itself. Realizing they have no chance against such a foe, Tormund shouts for them all to run and the Night's Watch brothers and wildlings alike desperately try to evacuate as ice melts and rock crumbles. Tormund and Beric watch in horror as the entire eastern extremity of the Wall collapses under Viserion's breath and crashes into the sea, leaving a gap between the Wall and the sea large enough for the Army of the Dead to cross. A road now open to them, the White Walkers direct the wights to begin their march into the North. Wights and giants and other monstrosities march by the thousands into the North as the undead Viserion and Night King fly overhead to lead the march.
