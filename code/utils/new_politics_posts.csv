"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort ‘repeatedly and brazenly violated the law’ and shows a ‘hardened adherence to committing crimes,’ prosecutors told a Washington federal judge.

They recommended no specific punishment for those crimes, saying that is the practice of the special counsel. Prosecutors noted that federal guidelines call for a sentence of 17 to 22 years, although under Manafort’s guilty plea in his D.C. case, the statutory maximum he faces is 10.

"I'm a cartoonist who used to want an old school staff political cartoonist job at a newspaper. Then along came online news and web animation. 

I stopped doing traditional political cartoons and started doing political animation for online news sites full-time around 2000. From the George W. Bush years to Trump, I've created around 1000 animated shorts-- but it freaks me out when I count them.

My cartoons have appeared in places like the San Francisco Chronicle's website, CBSNews.com, NPR.com, Newsweek.com and MotherJones.com.

You can see some of my more recent work here:

http://www.markfiore.com/july-september-2018/2018/7/11/pablo-a-family-separation-theme-song

I also do a daily cartoon and comics journalism for KQED News in San Francisco:

https://www.kqed.org/news/11689595/meet-the-programmers-of-san-quentin

I've won some awards but it seems like it would be annoying to list them here.
