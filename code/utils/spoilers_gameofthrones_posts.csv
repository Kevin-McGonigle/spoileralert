"For me it was when Jamie was fucking his sister over their incest child's dead body, and clearly enjoying it enough to get it up and keep going.

The rest of the series doesn't really gross me out (aside from other incest scenes). I laugh when bad or annoying people die and get annoyed when good or innocent people die.
Most of the deaths aren't actually that brutal, especially with how numb most people are to death considering it's in almost every popular tv show.",1
"For those of you who haven't heard of this theory or simply forgot, basically the show (and the books?) was hinting for a while that there was more to Tyrion than meets the eye...

There are a few key points to sum up the theory that Tyrion may very well be a Targaryen:

1. The hatred Tywin has towards him is unnaturally strong, stronger than you could expect towards his own child (even given his reasons). Perhaps his wife had Tyrion with another man (a Targaryen).
2. Tyrion's mother died during child birth, the same happened with Daenerys and Jon, both of which we know are Targaryens. A pattern developing here?
3. Tyrion was able to approach the dragons in the crypt and they were accepting of him just as they were to Jon on the cliff side. The only three characters we've ever seen this with are yet again Daenerys, Jon and Tyrion.
4. ""The dragon has three heads, three dragon riders, blah blah..."" Basically, it is believed that there must be one rider for each of the three dragons. There was always Daenerys, then eventually Jon, leaving a need for one more (seems they all need to be Targaryens).
5. Very possible that the story of Aerys (the Mad King) taking Tywins wife for a night is true and this could have been when Tyrion was conceived. *Thanks to /u/abc0802 for reminding me of this information.*

Anyway, all of those points strongly suggested that Tyrion may be half Lannister half Targaryen (or some combination of the two). 

**BUT, after the loss of Viserion, there are now just 2 dragons remaining on the side of the living leaving no real need for a third rider; that or the Night King is now the third rider. Either way, should we see either of these possibilities as a sign that the show is telling us Tyrion is in fact just a Lannister and Tywin really does hate him that much even though they are blood related?**",1
"As soon as they hear about the Wall being destroyed and that the Night King has resurrected Viserion and flying all over the North burning down house after house on their way to Winterfell do you think that Daenerys will just patiently stand still and wait for the dead to come to her. In the later seasons we have seen a more aggressive side of her so why should this change now.  


I believe she will refuse the advice of the other men at Winterfell and take both of her dragons to go and look for Viserion and ""end the battle before it begins"" with Daenerys gone this would also be the perfect chance for Bran to reveal to Jon his true heritage.   


After Daenerys sees yet another house burnt to a crisp she comes to the army of the dead and starts burning them. After a short while Daenerys sees the blue flames of Viserion hit Rhaegal, Rhaegal falls from the sky and lands on the ground, At this moment thousands of wrights jump on Rhaegal piercing the flesh of the beast. Daenerys realizing she has made a terrible decision quickly flys back to Winterfell .  


Back at Winterfell after the news has broken about Jons true hertiage and that Daenerys mistaken could have just lost them the war she starts to lose the support of some of her most loyal followers and perhaps even her army, Drogon now the last remaining dragon will no longer follow the orders of Daenerys who flies away just as soon as the Dead have reached the gates of Winterfell.  


As Daenerys is now a liability on the battlefield she is brought down to the crypts of Winterfell with a few other non essential personnel, Whilst all the fighting is happening on the outside Daenerys realizes that without the support of her followers and now that she is no longer the last living Targaryen she runs out of Winterfell through one of the hidden passages as she begins her search for Drogon, This will be the last time we see Daenerys for quite some time.

 

After the battle of Winterfell is over the remaining survivors look for Daenerys when they are unable to find her they believe that she was killed in the battle, they turn their attention to Jon as now he is the true heir to the iron throne, After a heated discussion Jon understands that its in his best interest to now pursue the iron throne as Jon now holds command of the remaining  survivors of the Unsullied, The Northern Army,  Wildlings and perhaps the Dorthraki, Perhaps Tyrion has convinced the Dorthraki and the Unsullied to avenge their queen by fighting for Jon remember they all believe she has died in the war.  


After the battle of Kings Landing with the Golden Company and Lannister soldiers vs Unsullied, North Army, Wildlings, Dorthraki and Cersei is killed Jon looks to resume his place on the Iron Throne as he goes to walk towards the Iron Throne, Daenerys comes flying through the throne room with Drogon, Daenerys goes on a rant about how she has been betrayed by everyone and after being away for so long she realizes that her father was right and she should ""Burn them All"" as she turns to Drogon she begins to scream the word Dracarys but before she could finish Jon drives his sword in the back of Daenerys killing her, Drogon turns around and burns Jon alive.   


Throne room now nearly burnt to a crisp both Daenerys and Jon dead at the bottom of the Iron Throne, A discussion is hold as the remaining survivors discuss who should sit on the Iron Throne, There are only 3 legitimate chances to sit on the throne, Sansa, Gendry and Tyrion. Sansa decides its best for her to honor her ancestors and return back to Winterfell where she will look to rebuild her families legacy, Which then leaves 2, Gendry decides that after he has witnessed what having power can do to you he declines the opportunity to sit on the throne which leaves Tyrion to become King Tyrion.  


You get your bittersweet ending with Tyrion on the throne and both Jon and Daenerys dead.",1
"If you were cersei would you have attempted to assassinate Dany?

I would have. My reasoning: I don't believe in magic or the gods (She blew up a sept remember). Dany's army lacks 2nd in commands with a claim to the throne, their loyalty is to her more than the office. So rig up the dragon pit with wildfire and concoct a plan to set it off while she's there to cut the head off the snake",1
"John snow becoming the night king to me seems like it's the only way to defeat to cersei. Dany and her army will see a loss of numbers since their is going to be a big battle in episode 3 supposedly. The knights of the vale are at winterfell currently meaning they will most likely get slaughtered as well. Cersei will not join the fight. She will most likely be gearing up to defeat the rest of danys retreating forces. Cersei will have the Golden companies army and eurons. Which have no losses. Lannisters are on danys side. Which means the only army capable of taking cersei on would be the night kings army. They are 100k strong and only defeatable via fire and dragon glass, something cersei doesn't have. Another way cersei can get defeated would be via eurons death. If REE... Theon can kill him. Eurons army will most likely be led by theons sister. Meaning cersei will have only the Golden company at her disposal. But the Golden company does state that they favor statics not bets. Meaning they will most likely pull out of her power. Making cersei powerless. We haven't seen the unsullied so that could potentially play a role but idk how I would fit them. John becoming the night king to defeat the true evil is bitter sweet imo. Cersei having a change of heart can dismantle this whole theory  though. Thoughts? ",1
I was rewatching my favorite scene in the show: Jon executing Janos Slynt in 5x3 and it made me wonder if Tyrion or Jon has any idea of the other's role in Janos's fate. Meaning if Tyrion knows that Jon executed Janos or if Jon knows that Tyrion sent Janos to the wall.,1
"TMFG selected Arya to a final purpose, that's why she was trained and let go by the FM. 

Additionally, the revival of Jon Snow is tied to the fate of Stannis, what are the odds that a priestess of Ashai was in the wall in the exact moment Jon was stabbed. 

The final purpose is that the living must win so they keep dying. A world without death, even if they rule the world is not what the balance should be. ",1
"So is the Lord of Light the god that is actually real in the game of thrones universe? Since we've seen him bring back Jon Snow and Beric Dondarrion (many times). Also, Melisandre's blood magic seemed to work when she threw the three leeches into the fire and called the usurpers' names. They're all dead now. Is the Lord of Light/The Red God the true deity?? And the Seven aren't?",1
"Oh my gosh this episode is intense. You have Cersei blowing up the sept of Baelor with wild fire. The killing of Grand Maester Pycelle. And Tommen committing suicide. And then you have Ser Davos confronting Melisandre about the death of Princess Shireen. (Which made me cry, because Davos truly loved her). And then Jon Snow birth mother was revealed. And he was claimed the King of the North. Dany sails for Westeros. And then Dany named Tyrion her hand. I mean this episode was intense, and it was so good. I am shocked by this season 6 finale. ",1
"When Mirri Maz Duur tells Daenerys that the blood magic spell requires a death to save a life, Daenerys thinks she is saying she will need to die. Mirri Maz Duur says no, not her life, pauses, and then says to bring Drogo's horse. During that pause she looks down and is clearly looking at Dany's pregnant belly. She gives her intentions away to the audience the moment the question is asked. Nothing big, and I'm not sure if it's been posted before, but I thought it was a cool direction for the actress to take. ",1
"I am currently rewatching all the seasons in preparation for the final season. When Rob Stark first crossed the Twins, I was under the impression that the Frey army joined him with the exception of 400 men to hold the crossing. In Season 3 after Rob loses the Karstark men he says that the only army who hasn't sworn for one side or another is the Freys, which is why he heads back to the Twins before the Red Wedding. Its been a while since I read the books.",1
"Bran has a huge role to play in season 8, but hes done nothing but get people killed and confirm Jon's parentage (which Howland Reed couldve likely done). What could he possibly do to stop the white walkers and redeem himself from being a liability for 67 episodes? 

Here's my guess: he goes inside Jon's mind and forces him to kill Daenerys. Jon will never kill her willingly, and only Bran will know that the Azor Ahai prophecy is true when he sees back in time and watches the man himself. What are the other theories on how he will stop the army of the dead?",1
I really want to see what he looks like now under his helmet. Hopefully we get to see in Season 8.,1
"I know the episode where they take his last baby and turn him, but what is their reasoning and what's the long game?

I don't have a clue, but I guess they might be future white walkers kept beyond the wall as a back up plan if the Night King fails. 

They can't fight now they maybe in another 1000 years they will be ready. ",1
"I don't think this has ever been clarified in the show. After Tywin's death, who became Lord or Lady of Casterly Rock? Also, who holds the title now?

To my understanding, Tyrion as Tywin's secondborn son and only eligible heir became Lord of Casterly Rock after Tywin's death. However, Tyrion went into exile and never assumed the role.

Jaime was in the King's Guard at the time, so he is ruled out.

Did Cersei become Lady of Casterly Rock upon Tywin's death? If so, who ruled over the Rock while she was imprisoned by the High Sparrow? Did Kevan rule it in her stead?

Was Jaime named Lord of Casterly Rock ofscreen, as he is seen commanding the Lannister armies in season 7, after he was removed from the King's Guard?

Any thoughts?",1
"So I'm watching the show for the first time and I just finished season six, and I came to think of something: Am I the only one who thinks Loras Tyrell deserved so much better? He spent his last days locked in a cell before confessing to his ""crimes"", for then to get basically tortured by the sparrows. All this just to die in Cercei Lannisters wildfire attack moments after. I realize Loras might not have been the most likeable character, but it's still kind of sad to me, considering his potential to play a big role in ""wars to come"", not to mention his potential to grow as a person and become more likeable. Does anyone agree with me? Are there any other characters you thought deserved better?",1
"Now I know everyone loves to talk about Hardhome and Battle of the Bastards.

Which episodes do you think are the most underrated.

I feel like Watchers on the Wall is one of them, thoughts?",1
"It is taken as gospel that it refers to Targaryens. However, the original prophecy from the wood witch spoke of only The Prince That Was Promised that would be born from the Aerys II-Rhaella line. Whether it refers to a man or a woman, it refers to only one person from that line.

&#x200B;

Rhaegar was so obsessed with the prophecy that he felt he needed to name his children Rhaenys, Aegon and Visenya. He felt Aegon alone wouldn't be able to fulfil the prophecy, that he needed two sisters to help him, like Aegon the Conqueror. Obviously, that didn't work out with Elia Martell giving birth to only Rhaenys and Aegon and so he went to Lyanna, hoping she would give birth to Visenya. That also didn't pan out. Instead, we got another Aegon, and Elia's children died.

&#x200B;

So now most people are speculating that the three heads are three of the following choices: Dany, Jon, Tyrion, Night King, Jaime, Bran. But Rhaegar never considered that the dragon's three heads refers to three random Targaryens, he needed them to be siblings. So much so that he married Lyanna, triggering a war, to ensure there would be a Visenya. Why go to all that trouble? Because Rhaegar felt the bond of family would be the strongest and help Aegon. By Rhaegar's logic, the above choices wouldn't be good enough. Pick any trio and they wouldn't have a strong enough bond like the original Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys.

&#x200B;

So which three characters, preferably siblings, preferably one boy with two sisters, do we know that fit Rhaegar's vision?  


Jon, Arya and Sansa. We know Jon is Aegon. The only ""sisters"" he has are Arya and Sansa. If we are to take Bran at his word that he's just the Three-Eyed Raven now, then that becomes even more poignant. I'm not saying Arya and Sansa are secret Targaryens or will ride dragons or will marry Jon. But the idea of 'the dragon must have three heads' is not unlike 'the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives'. The fact that Dany has/had three dragons is irrelevant; it's about family and unity, not actual dragons. Jon might be the Prince That Was Promised, but he needs his sisters. Arya, like her idol Visenya, is a warrior who dabbles in dark arts and is skilled with a sword. Sansa, like Rhaenys, is more lady-like and understands diplomacy. When the truth about Jon is revealed, you can bet Sansa and Arya will stand beside Jon. The last teaser seemed to highlight the importance of this trio in the final season as well.

  
And let's not forget when Tywin spoke to Arya about Aegon and his feats, Arya countered him, saying, ""Aegon and his sisters. It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya too.""

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 'The dragon must have three heads' refers to family and unity, and thus refers to Jon, Arya and Sansa.",1
"IMO, Cleganebowl wont happen. ""The Hound"" was slowly dying throughout his journy with Arya and he finally died when he lost to Brienne (of fucking tarth) and is now just Sandor. Arya will probably kill the mountain because she has the speed advantage and it is foreshadowed by her list. Sandors character arc has gone from a dog who is filled with hate to a man who is passionate deep down and wants to redeem himself, it would be stupid to revert him back to his hatrid. When he says you know whats coming for you at the dragon pit to the mountain hes probably just talking about death, or he may even be inferring that the mountain will die by fire, perhaps beric will kill him with his flaming sword as him and sandor are somewhat mates now",1
"During the Battle of Blackwater, Stannis attacks the Mud Gate. After Stannis pushes back the first Lannister foray, Tyrion leads men through a sewer that comes out on the beach near the wall, not far from Stannis. It may be the way it was filmed, but it looked like the sewer was a few dozen yards away from the gate.

I assume Stannis didn't know about it, but imagine if he did...all that would have stood between his legions and King's Landing was a rusty lock. It bothers me to think about it. A wide open sewer right on the wall that is so easy to get into.

All he would need is 20 good men to get in to cause enough chaos to turn the tide.",1
"At S05E07 Maester Aemon says ""Egg laughs like that"" while talking about Gilly's son Sam. ""Egg"" he meant was Aegon Targeryan. It could be a foreshadow about Gilly's son become the King who was promised.",1
So I'm rewatching the series and noticed that anyone who wasn't at Castle Black doesn't know about Jon's murder. Yet no one (aside from Tyrion) asks how he became King in the North if he already swore an oath to the Night's Watch. The northerners just crowned him King without anyone raising suspicion as to what happened. Why is no one asking? ,1
"The first 4 seasons, he was great. We see how he is, we learn why with Tywin and all. S2 he has the rise to power and falls. S3 he suffers, S4 he's fed up and the speech and killing Tywin are so satisfying. I guess 5 was decent, somewhat of a transition period. 

But 6 and 7 have just been disappointing. He's a glorified advisor really, always in Dany's shadow and in 7 his plans were just stupid. I wanted to see him actually do something remarkable, like the blackwater and the build up to it. 

It would have been so satisfying after everything he's been through for him to succeed and make a name for himself. Instead we get this and in S7 his battle plans totally fail just so Cersei can look badass.  

Look Ik he's not a king or anything and I don't expect that. But it sucks so much to see him become a supporting character that makes funny jokes and advises. He could be so much more. ",1
"Although Cersei is a formidable opponent and one that has survived seven seasons, I would argue is not the best at winning the iron throne. I feel if you were to take her character and start her were someone like Varys or Littlefinger started (basically from not much) she would have been dead a long time ago. What do you guys think? Who is this best at playing the game for the iron throne?",1
"Dany wore the same outfit for the KL meeting as she wore during the battle in episode 4. She was probably ready to ""burn them all"" in case Tyrion's ""clever plan"" wouldn't work.

"After watching through the series again (in preparation for season 8, of course), I realized that a lot of Uncle Benjen's time beyond the Wall is mostly unaccounted for. As someone who's only seen the TV series, I'm not sure if it's really covered in the books, but I think it could make for a very interesting spinoff game. 

Imagine a “Shadow of Mordor” type game where you play as Benjen during his time beyond the Wall, just cracking skulls with a flaming flail and stacking white-walker bodies a mile high, culminating in an epic, one vs. all battle after you save Jon Snow. That would be the most metal shit I've ever played in my life. ",1
"\[Spoiler\] I hope some of you can explain this to me because im a bit confused by it. So according to some lore Videos, the Nightking was once a Man of the Nightwatch until he met a Witch and fell in Love with her and so on but in the Series we have a Scene where the Children of the Forest ""create"" the first White Walker. So if its true that the Nightking really was a Man of the Nightwatch. Who is the Guy that they made to be the first White Walker, do we know where he is today and is he still ""alive""?",1
"When Danni enters the House of the Undying to find her dragons at the end of S2 she sees some things. One of the first things she sees is the Iron Throne as she stands in what appears to be King's Landing. It's deserted and kinda ashy/foggy. Above her the roof is scorched away. We had just learned a few episodes back that only dragon's fire can melt stone.
A bit of foreshadowing to what we'll see in S8??

"I know the night king is just for the show, and I know the night's king was the 13th commander of the nights watch. The great other is supposed to be the antithesis to r'hllor, the god of light, so is it possible the Great Other is the books version of the shows Night King set to debut in TWOW

When Jorah approaches Quaithe in regards to Danys missing dragons, she is putting some form of a blessing on a sailor who is said to be travelling through Old Valyria.

That's the old gods."" And just totally on board? Were they like ""dang! Sansa is bad@$$!""  I need to find that fan fiction that is probably out there. ",1

"Here are my thoughts.

8x01: Winter is Here

Rather obvious, and also a callback to the Pilot episode, which is fitting since this is the first episode of the last season. It begins immediately where the last left off and it sets up the fight against the Dead.

8x02: The Long Night

The majority of the fight against the Dead. It ends right on the climax and when things look the most grimm for the living.

8x03: Others

A long overdue backstory episode, one that will also set up the prequel spinoff.

8x04: A Dream of Spring

The conclusion of the fight against the Dead. It ends on a hopeful note, but then...

8x05: The Dwarf, the Cripple and the Mother of Madness

Echoing Tyrion's quote from an earlier season, it's a fitting title to conclude the fight against the series' longest running human antagonist, now that the longest running supernatural antagonist has been dealt with. A Lannister centric, maybe with some flashbacks from their childhood if necessary.

8x06: A Song of Ice and Fire

The epic conclusion!

What do you guys think? How do these sound? Likely? Unlikely? Corny and/or stupid? What would you choose and why? Let me know!",1
Rewatching the show just finished season 6 and I'm a little confused how Dany got the ships to cross the sea. I know she worked with Theon but did she agree to marry his uncle? Then is Theon also working with his uncle? Or did they get the ships another way?,1
"* **JAIME AS HAND OF THE KING**

&nbsp;


As many of you know, I am a huge supporter of the Theory that Jaime will be Hand of the King, for King Jon (still not sure what name he is going to choose). So, I decided to make a little selection of all the scenes that foreshadowed Jaime being Hand on season 1, which was the season that made me really pay attention to this idea. 

&nbsp;

On season one we were literally told by Tyrion Lannister on episode 1, that Jaime was the handsome brother and that Tyrion was the smart one. That of course, its not a lie, but I do think it was a way for books and show to deceives us, to overestimate Tyrion's intelligence and underestimate Jaime's capability as a leader and as a judge of human character. 

&nbsp;

* **SEASON 1 EPISODE 1**

>Cersei Lannister: **“You should be Hand of the King”**

>Jaime Lannister: “That's a honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.”

&nbsp;


In his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days. Remember Jaime always uses jokes to deflect insecurance or frustration. I actually think he likes the idea. 

&nbsp;

>Jaime (to Tyrion): Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. **Don't leave alone with these people.**

&nbsp;

When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. “The Starks are feasting us this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people”. This was the QUOTE that got my attention. For some reason this line was shinning like a big foreshadowing to me. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>Jaime (to Jon Snow): “Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.

&nbsp;

On episode 2, we have Jaime taking Jon right hand and thanking him for taking the black and joining the Nights Watch. They even make sure to pan the camera on Jaime taking Jon's hand.


&nbsp;

>Jaime Lannister : “Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.”

>Eddard Stark: “Glad to see you're protecting the throne.”

>Jaime Lannister : “Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, **I wonder? What's the line ? The King shits and the Hand wipes.**

&nbsp;
 

When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King “how do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it? Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.

&nbsp;

>CERSEI: “I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.”

>CERSEI: **“Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.”**

>KING ROBERT: “I suppose this is where **you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.”**

&nbsp;

In the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.

&nbsp;

>Robert Baratheon: “Seven hells! don't start with her again. The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, **I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.”**

&nbsp;

Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **SEASON 1 EPISODE 7**

&nbsp;

>Tywin Lannister (to Jaime): “You're blessed with abilities that few men possess. You're blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the Kingdoms, and you're still blessed with youth. And what have you done with these blessings? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings, one a madman, the other a drunk. The future of our family will be determined in these next few months. We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years...or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did. **I need you to become the man you were always meant to be. Not next year, not tomorrow...now.**

&nbsp;

Finally, on episode 7 when Tywin Lannister is later introduced to the story. In this scene  he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. And that for me it will be Jaime arc on season 8. 

&nbsp;

Jaime completely outsmarted Tyrion in season 7 using the mistakes he made in the past as a lesson. Jaime and Jon were literally the two leaders on season 7 trying to save their people from unecessary deaths. He went to Cersei to tells her that they couldnt win against Dragons, he wanted her to surrender to Dany to save the lives of his armies and his people; he decided to abandon her to go fight North and save the realm. Finally free from Cersei, going North to help the Starks and fight for the realm Jaime is finally becoming the man he was supposed to be.

Now u/fedonciadale found several of foreshadow of this theory from the books and it's a remarkable work. I want to share just a small part here.  In the books it is not a pin, but a chain of hands that signifies the office of the hand.And the mummers make a rope and hang Jaime's hand around his neck like a chain.

&nbsp;


>Bolton's silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoat's slobbering malevolence. Pale as morning mist, his eyes concealed more than they told. Jaime misliked those eyes. They reminded him of the day at King's Landing when Ned Stark had found him seated on the Iron Throne. The Lord of the Dreadfort finally pursed his lips and said, **“You have lost a hand.”**

>""No,“ said Jaime, “I have it here, hanging round my neck.”

But when Tyrell had taken his leave and Tommen had been sent off with Ser Addam Marbrand, she turned on Jaime angrily. **“Are you drunk or dreaming, ser? Pray tell, why am I having supper with that grasping fool and his puerile wife?”** A gust of wind stirred her golden hair. “I will not name him Hand, if that's what—”

>**“You need Tyrell,”** Jaime broke in, **“but not here. Ask him to capture Storm's End for Tommen. Flatter him, and tell him you need him in the field, to replace Father. Mace fancies himself a mighty warrior. Either he will deliver Storm's End to you, or he will muck it up and look a fool. Either way, you win.”**

>**“Storm's End?”** Cersei looked thoughtful. **“Yes, but... Lord Tyrell has made it tediously plain that he will not leave King's Landing till Tommen marries Margaery.”**

>Jaime sighed. **“Then let them wed. It will be years before Tommen is old enough to consummate the marriage.** And until he does, the union can always be set aside. **Give Tyrell his wedding and send him off to play at war.”**

>A wary smile crept across his sister's face. **“Even sieges have their dangers,”** she murmured. **“Why, our Lord of Highgarden might even lose his life in such a venture.”**

>**“There is that risk,”** conceded Jaime. **“Especially if his patience runs thin this time, and he elects to storm the gate.”**

>Cersei gave him a lingering look. “You know,” she said, **“for a moment you sounded quite like Father.”**

>(Jaime, AFFC)

&nbsp;

So, this is my theory. I really believe Jaime will be the Hand of the King on the end of this story.

"The romance and future marriage between Jon Snow and Sansa Stark has been foreshadowed pretty much since book 1.

&nbsp;

* **YOU WILL MARRY A KING……**

&nbsp;

>“You,” Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, “will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.” Arya screwed up her face. **""No,"" she said, ""that's Sansa.""** 

>(Eddard V- A Game of Thrones)

&nbsp;

For me this quote is one of the most important quotes from the entire series because it pretty much sets up for the audience both Sansa and Arya story arc. Sansa will be the sister who will marry and have children and fulfill her childhood dreams of a happy family, which is why Love, marriage and children will be a constant theme in Sansa's arc story. She will be treated as an object, passed around by the powerful players of the story, all interested in her claim of Winterfell and the North; she will be forced into marriage alliances and her future children will be desired for their claim in the North. Sansa will try to survive as much as she can, keeping still a slim hope to find love and happiness and maybe one day fulfill that sweet dream of a rebuilding her destroyed family.

Arya will follow another path; she will be a warrior and ruler on her own. Arya always wanted to be the keeper of her own holdfast, she wanted to be a knight and fight in battle and most important, I believe Arya wanted to feel the independence that most women in Westeros could never feel. Not that love and marriage is not impossible for her, but I feel George wants Arya to be a Queen regent on her own.

George is trying to tells us in this passage of the books that women should be able to choose their own paths and if its love, marriage and children what they wish for they should have it, but if its not, they should be free to figure out her own destiny. The tragedy of Lyanna Stark was that she never had a choice and was forced into marry someone she never cared for, and I believe George wants to show with both Sansa and Arya that girls should be free to choose their own dreams., because BOTH dreams are equality valid.

* **A CLOAK STAINED IN FIRE AND BLOOD……..**

>When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. **She found his cloak on the floor**, twisted up tight, **the white wool stained with blood and fire.** The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.

>(A Clash of Kings - Sansa VII)

&nbsp;

Sansa cloaked herself with a cloak stained in ""Fire and Blood"" the words of House Targaryen. For me this has always been one of the biggest foreshadows on the book and its interesting to notice how George used the character of Sandor Cleagane as a redherring for this scene in order to not make so obvious the connection with Jon.

It was only when tumblr user occupyvenus made the connection of this particular scene with one that happened a few chapters before In the book A CLASH OF KINGS that it became pretty obvious this quote was about Jon Snow.

&nbsp;


>“I've never lain with any woman but Cersei. In my own way, I've been truer than your Ned ever was. Poor old dead Ned. So who has shit for honor now, I ask you? **What was the name of that bastard he fathered?”**

>Catelyn took a step backwards. **“Brienne.”**

>**“No, that wasn't it.”** Jaime Lannister upended the flagon. A trickled ran down onto his face, bright as blood. “**Snow**, that was the one. **Such a white name** … **like the pretty cloaks** they give us in the Kingsguard when we swear our pretty oaths.”

>A Clash of Kings - Catelyn VII

&nbsp;


* **THE ORDER OF THE CHAPTERS OF THE BOOKS…….**

&nbsp;

* In the first book A GAME OF THRONES, chapter 4 Eddard I, we have King Robert arriving at Winterfell and asking to visit Lyanna tomb in the crypts of the castle. While there King Robert decides to ask for Sansa's hand in marriage for his son prince Joffrey. This is the chapter where Sansa and Joffrey become officially betrothed to each other and their Royal engagement its made official. The very next chapter? **JON**. This is also the chapter where Jon Snow will get drunk in the Feats for the king and ask uncle Ben to join the NightsWatch. 

&nbsp;


* In a CLASH OF KINGS chapter 52, SANSA IV, Sansa will get her period and be finally “fit to bear children to the king”. Cersei then tries, as best as she can, to be a mother figure to Sansa in this very special moment and gives her a womanly advice. She tells her that love is a dangerous feeling that makes us all weaker and it should wiser for her to love only her children. Once again we have a chapter discussing Sansa future marriage to a king and the following chapter is **JON VII.**

&nbsp;



* Finally on A STORM OF SWORDS, we have the famous chapter 68, Sansa VI, where she laments that no one will ever marry her for love, its only her name and Winterfell they all want.  The very next chapter of the book? **JON**. Again, thats not a coincidence, George does this, he said that he takes a lot of planning and caring about the way he writes and structures his books.

&nbsp;
______________________________________________-

&nbsp;

* **THEIR ROMANCE HAS ALSO BEEN VERY CAREFULLY FORESHADOWED BUT IN A VERY HIDDEN WAY. WHICH MAKES EVEN MORE INTERESTING FOR ME……**


**A CLASH OF KINGS – THE WINTER ROSE**

In A CLASH OF KINGS we will have George very quietly making the connection with Jon, Sansa and the tale of Bael the Bard.  While was I re reading the books I noticed that George was playing with the chapters orders and trying to tells us some hints of the story by putting characters chpaters next to each other. The first time Jon meets Ygritte on “A CLASH OF KINGS”, chapter 51, she tells him a story of Bael the Bard and the Blue Winter Rose:

&nbsp;


>""The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael's head, but never could take him, and the taste o' failure galled him. One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak. When word o' that got back, Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson. So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and walked into Winterfell one winter's night with harp in hand, naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos. Sygerrik means 'deceiver' in the Old Tongue, that the First Men spoke, and the giants still speak.

>""North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark's own table, and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone. The old songs he played, and new ones he'd made himself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered to let him name his own reward. **'All I ask is a flower,' Bael answered, 'the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o' Winterfell.'**

>""Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. **So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o' the winter roses be plucked for the singer's payment.** And so it was done. But when morning come, the singer had vanished . . . and so had Lord Brandon's maiden daughter. **Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain.""**

>(A Clash of Kings – Jon VI)

&nbsp;

Right next in the following chapter 52, Sansa has her first flowering. This is the chapter where Sansa gets her first period and its now **“fit to bear children to the King.”**

&nbsp;



>""The blood is the seal of your womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. You've had your first flowering, no more."" Sansa had never felt less flowery. ""My lady mother told me, but I... I thought it would be different.""""Different how?""""I don't know. Less... less messy, and more magical.” Queen Cersei laughed. ""Wait until you birth a child, Sansa. A woman's life is nine parts mess to one part magic, you'll learn that soon enough... and the parts that look like magic often turn out to be messiest of all."" She took a sip of milk. ""So now you are a woman. Do you have the least idea of what that means?"" ""It means that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,"" said Sansa, ""and to bear children for the king."" …….
Do you want to be loved, Sansa?"" ""Everyone wants to be loved."" ""I see flowering hasn't made you any brighter,"" said Cersei. ""Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.""

>(A Clash of Kings – Sansa IV)

&nbsp;


After getting her period for the first time and be finally ready to bear children for the king, Sansa is taken to see Cersei (on chapter 52) who uses the moment to give Sansa womanly advice about love. She warns her that she will probably never receive the love and attention from Joffrey, that she used to dream of.  She warns Sansa that love is dangerous and make us weaker. The following chapter of the book is **JON VII.**

&nbsp;

>“Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. Do you want to be loved, Sansa?” “Everyone wants to be loved.” **“I see flowering hasn't made you any brighter,”** said Cersei. “Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.”

>(A Clash of Kings – Sansa IV)

&nbsp;

In the end of chapter Cersei warns Sansa about love and how dangerous it can be. The following chapter of the book is also **JON VII**. George really wanted us to picture Jon, Sansa and the Blue Winter Rose tale all together. For me this is one of the biggest clues that not only Jon and Sansa will marry but also, its their child that will continue House Stark.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **A STORM OF SWORDS – THE FALLING SNOW**

&nbsp;

In A storm of Swords, George used the prologue of the book to foreshadow Jon and Sansa romance, using the snow to symbolize Jon Snow. In the two paragraphs under, Chett will lament that heavy snow has ruined his plans for desertion and that Jon Snow and Sam stole his comfortable position as Maester Aemon's steward: and that Jon Snow stole his position.

>“He could feel tears freezing to his cheeks. It isn't fair, he wanted to scream. **Snow would ruin everything he'd worked for, all his careful plans.** It was a heavy fall, thick white flakes coming down all about him. How would they find their food caches in the snow, or the game trail they meant to follow east? They won't need Dywen nor Bannen to hunt us down neither, not if we're tracking through fresh snow. And snow hid the shape of the ground, especially by night. A horse could stumble over a root, break a leg on a stone. We're done, he realized. Done before we began. We're lost. There'd be no lord's life for the leechman's son, no keep to call his own, no wives nor crowns. Only a wildling's sword in his belly, and then an unmarked grave. **The snow's taken it all from me … the bloody snow …”**

>**“Snow had ruined him once before. Snow and his pet pig.”**

>(ASOS Prologue)

&nbsp;

And later we have Jon Snow introduced as as “the snow of winterfell”……

>“The singer rose to his feet. ""I'm Mance Rayder,” he said as he put aside the lute. “And you are Ned Stark's bastard, **the Snow of Winterfell.”**
>( A Storm of Swords – Jon I)


&nbsp;


Then comes Sansa's chapter at the end of the book, where she will feel snow falling down her lips and touching her almost like a lover……..

&nbsp;

>Snow was falling on the Eyrie.


>Yet she stepped out all the same. Her boots tore ankle-deep holes into the smooth white surface of the snow, yet made no sound. Sansa drifted past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees, and wondered if she were still dreaming. Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover's kisses, and melted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes. **She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.**

>(A Storm of Swords - Sansa VIII)


This last paragraph is very dear to my heart. How George foreshadows Jon and Sansa first kiss its one of the sweetest parts of the books. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **IN A FEAST FOR CROWS – SANSA'S FIRST LOVE**

In A FEAST FOR CROWS, chapter 23, we have Sansa playing the role of Alayne Stone, Littlefinger bastard daughter. In this chapter Sansa remembers Lord Yohn Royce son,  Ser Wayman Royce and how she fell madly in love with him when he visited Winterfell on his way to take the black on the Nights Watch. If we go back to the prologue of the first book, we will find out that surprising, Ser Waymar physical description is identical of Jon Snow. George is trying to tell us that Sansa will probably be physical attracted to Jon Snow once she is reunited with him later in the story.  (randomtvramblings was the first to notice this detail).

>""Bronze Yohn knows me,"" she reminded him. ""He was a guest at Winterfell when his son rode north to take the black."" **She had fallen wildly in love with Ser Waymar, she remembered dimly, but that was a lifetime ago, when she was a stupid little girl.** ""And that was not the only time. Lord Royce saw . . . he saw Sansa Stark again at King's Landing, during the Hand's tourney.""

> A FEAST FOR CROWS,  Alayne I


&nbsp;


In the A GAME OF THRONES prologue, Waymar Royce is described as follows:

&nbsp;


>Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, **grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife**. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. 

>A GAME OF THRONES, Prologue

&nbsp;

Notice how similar this description is to Jon:

&nbsp;

>**Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black**, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. **Jon was slender** where Robb was muscular, **dark** where Robb was fair, **graceful and quick** where his half brother was strong and fast.

>A GAME OF THRONES, Bran I

&nbsp;


Jon Snow and Ser Waymar Royce are very similar phisically, and Waymar was the first crush of Sansa. I believe George was trying to tells us that Sansa will be attracted to Jon Snow once they are reunited on Castle Black..

&nbsp;

* **JON SNOW BECOMING THE HERO OF SANSA'S DREAMS…..**


>“Sweet one,” her father said gently, “listen to me. When you're old enough, I will make you a match with a high lord who's worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong. This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake. **That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.”** 

>( A Game of Thrones – Sansa III)
 
........

>She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, **for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard.** 

>(A Clash of Kings – Sansa IV)
 
..........

>They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes. “I'm Prince Aemon the Dragonknight,” Jon would call out, and Robb would shout back, “Well, I'm Florian the Fool.” Or Robb would say, “I'm the Young Dragon,” and Jon would reply, **“I'm Ser Ryam Redwyne.”** 

A Storm of Swords – Jon II

Notice how Sansa's heros match with with the ones Jon's used to pretend to be as a child. 

&nbsp;


>“Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, **wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head.**

>A game of Thrones – Sansa VI 

&nbsp;


>""I will not hang him,"" said Jon. ""Bring him here."" ""Oh, Seven save us,"" he heard Bowen Marsh cry out. The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, **""Edd, fetch me a block,""** and unsheathed Longclaw. 

>A dance of Dragons – Jon II

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **AND FINALLY, THEIR DREAMS COMPLETING EACH OTHER'S…….**

&nbsp;

One of the sweetest things about the tale of ASOAIF, it's the realization that Jon and Sansa are having the same dreams about their future, without each other knowing about it. They dream of peace, going back to home and rebuilding their ancestral home; they dream about marriage and having children named by the brothers they lost in the war; they want to rebuild the family they believe its gone for ever…..

&nbsp;


>“She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in their laps, or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while they floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge. **""If I give him Sons, he may come to love me.** She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon**, and raise them all to be as Valiant as Ser Loras. And to hate Lannisters, too. In Sansa's dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya.” 

>A STORM OF SWORDS, Sansa II

>“I would need to steal her if I wanted her love, **but she might give me children**. I might someday hold a son of my own blood in my arms. A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of, since he decide to live his life on the wall. **I could name him Robb”**..-

>A STORM OF SWORDS, Jon XII

&nbsp;

Rebuilding Winterfell……

&nbsp;

>The snow fell and the castle rose. Two walls ankle-high, the inner taller than the outer. Towers and turrets, keeps and stairs, a round kitchen, a square armory, the stables along the inside of the west wall. It was only a castle when she began, **but before very long Sansa knew it was Winterfell.**

>A Storm of Swords - Sansa VII

>**Winterfell, he thought.** Theon left it burned and broken, **but I could restore it. Surely his father would have wanted that, and Robb as well**. They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins.

>A Storm of Swords - Jon XII

&nbsp;

So, yeahh, I dont understand when people keep telling me there is no foreshadowing of this romance in the books, when in my opnion, its one of the most foreshadowed matches in the entire novel. 


BTW, they are no only foreshadowed to be in a romance, but also, to be the final King and Queen of this story.................

&nbsp;

______________________________

* **JON AS A KING**

Jon Snow foreshadowing as the final King is found pretty much on every single book from the series. 

&nbsp;


>**""Kings are a rare sight in the north.""**

>Robert snorted. ""More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!""

Eddard  - AGOT


&nbsp;


>**""King,"" croaked the raven.** The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont's shoulder. **""King,"" it said again**, strutting back and forth.

>""He likes that word,"" Jon said, smiling.

>""An easy word to say. An easy word to like.""

>**""King,"" the bird said again.**

>""I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.""

>""The realm has three kings already, and that's two too many for my liking."" Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger, **but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow.**

>It made him feel odd. 

Jon I, ACOK


&nbsp;

>He rose and dressed in darkness, as Mormont's raven muttered across the room. ""Corn,"" the bird said, and, **""King,"" and, ""Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.""** That was queer. The bird had never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall.

* **SANSA AS A QUEEN**

&nbsp;


>“Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King's Hand and **a father to queens.** I never asked for this cup to pass to me.”

A game of Thrones - Catelyn I

&nbsp;





>“You,” Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, “will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.” Arya screwed up her face. **""No,"" she said, ""that's Sansa.""**

>'I've never seen an aurochs,' Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table. The direwolf took it from her hand, **as delicate as a queen.""**

&nbsp;




>""The night's first traitors,” the queen said, “but not the last, I fear. Have Ser Ilyn see to them, and put their heads on pikes outside the stables as a warning.” As they left, she turned to Sansa. “Another lesson you should learn, if you hope to sit beside my son. Be gentle on a night like this and you'll have treasons popping up all about you like mushrooms after a hard rain. **The only way to keep your people loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.”**

>**“I will remember, Your Grace,”** said Sansa, though she had always heard that love was a surer route to the people's loyalty than fear. **If I am ever a queen, I'll make them love me.**

&nbsp;



>He had another cup of wine as he dressed, then took his wife by the arm and escorted her from the Kitchen Keep to join the river of silk, satin, and velvet flowing toward the throne room. Some guests had gone inside to find their places on the benches. Others were milling in front of the doors, enjoying the unseasonable warmth of the afternoon. **Tyrion led Sansa around the yard, to perform the necessary courtesies.**

>**She is good at this, he thought**, as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that his cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown, and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first time he'd left his sickbed since the battle. He looks ghastly. Lancel's hair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick. Without his father beside him holding him up, he would surely have collapsed. Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. **She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he'd had the sense to love her. He wondered if his nephew was capable of loving anyone.**

A Storm of Swords - Tyrion VIII


&nbsp;



>""You would not believe half of what is happening in King's Landing, sweetling. Cersei stumbles from one idiocy to the next, helped along by her council of the deaf, the dim, and the blind. I always anticipated that she would beggar the realm and destroy herself, but I never expected she would do it quite so fast. It is quite vexing. I had hoped to have four or five quiet years to plant some seeds and allow some fruits to ripen, but now … it is a good thing that I thrive on chaos. **What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three queens, I fear.”**

>**“Three queens?” She did not understand.**

>Nor did Petyr choose to explain. Instead, he smiled and said, “I have brought my sweet girl back a gift.”

A Feast for Crows - Alayne II



&nbsp;


As I said before, I believe Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will marry and rule the 7 kingdoms as King and Queen by the end of this story....


TLDR - Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will marry in the final season and rule Westeros as the final King and Queen.

",1
" I got a quick question for you guys. I started rewatching the show and I'm currently on season 1 episode 5. When Arya is in the dungeons she overhears Varys and Illyrio Mopatis speaking about the Dothraki coming to Westeros, Illyrio says he wants more time because Khal Drogo will wait for his son to be born, while Varys asks him to speed it up, since there is a war starting between the Lannisters and the Starks. 

Illyrio was the one that organized the marriage between Dany and Drogo. It seems like Varys was in on the plan too and like they're partners. So why does he want Dany killed immediately after that scene? Is he playing Illyrio and just using him for information? It seems like he was helping coming up with the plan to bring Dany and Drogo together though. Why would he do that and then decide to kill her? What did I miss? Did it have something to do with Ned not being like the previous hand? ",1
"You probably heard about the Tourney of Ashford theory before. 

If you don't know small explanation; (you can skip to the next paragraph if you know)

Sansa's marriages/bethrotals are going same order with 5 champions of Lord Ashford's daughter.
1. Lyonel Baratheon. — Joffrey Baratheon
2. Leo Tyrell — Willas Tyrell
3. Tybolt Lannister — Tyrion Lannister
4. Humphrey Hardyng — Harry Hardyng
5. Valarr Targaryen — ???

So what do you think? Can this theory be true? If it is, who can be the one as Targaryen category?",1
"I'm a lurker who just enjoys reading other people's theories, no matter how crazy some might seem. Ha.

Anyway, the question of who really owned the Valeryan steel dagger that was used by Brandon's assassin comes up frequently, but my question is...

Why did whoever want Bran dead deem it necessary to use such an elaborate blade in the first place? Any old knife or dagger would have done the job, so why was the assassin equipped with such a fine weapon? 

I'm not buying these theories about Bran being the Night King or whatever, too much of a flight of fancy for me, but why try to kill him with that particular blade? Being caught was risky because the blade could lead back to someone (which happened!) and why waste a valuable asset on a common cutthroat? Is it just lazy writing, and the only reason was so they could link it someone in later episodes. 

Always seemed odd. Just wondered if anyone can think of another reason it had to be that weapon that killed Bran.",1
"I know it would throw the whole storyline off because it would be obvious he was a Targaryen, but I just think it's so crazy and cool that the Targaryen's have such strong bloodlines, but Jon's the most Stark-looking of them all. Especially after everything that happened with Robert and Joffery, and ""the seed is strong"".

I think it'd be kind of cool if he had white hair and Ned made up some bullshit like he was cursed as the Stark bastard with white hair. Like if he was super Stark looking, just with white hair.

I mean, they do call him the White Wolf...",1
"I know someone just posted about this but I wanted to go in a little more detail on why I feel like it's true. I remember Jamie saying the Mad Kings last words were something along the line of  “burn them all, just like he had by saying the past few hours”. 
    I see a huge connection between the Hodor storyline and the Mad King. Bran probably went back to the Mad King in a vision and someone yelling burn them all, maybe dead bodies in winterfell during a white walker attack, got it into the Mad Kings head. 
     I don't really see the point of having Ned being able to somewhat hear Bran in his vision and Hodors whole storyline if it wasn't leading up to this. ",1
"What if at some point King Stannis reappears, and then everyone bends the knee to him and he leads his people against the white walkers? That would be EPIC, but probably too intelligent a twist for D&D",1
" Season 8 will be an epic finale to the journey to win the game of thrones. These are my predictions of events and aftermaths, not fact or canon.

White Walkers: The White Walkers will be the greatest threat known to the Westerlands since the first arrival of the Dragons. The White Walkers shall reak untold destruction and slaughter any unable to get away as they ravage the North. Battle after battle they shall win as all the houses are unable to unite and face as one host to combat the white walkers individually losing battles. Until the final battle when just once the Kingdom has sent all hit has against the White Walkers. It will be an epic battle involving the hundreds of thousands of troops both Living and unliving. For every soldier killed in battle he becomes undead and attacks his comrades who just a moment ago fought alongside. It will be a brutal victory that will only end once Jon Snow and Daenerys ride both dragons to kill the Ice Dragon and the Night king in an Epic Duel.

House Targaryen-

Daenerys Targaryen: Daenerys will survive the events of Got and will end up either as Queen in the Westerlands or my own personal theory as Khaleesi in Essos.

House Stark-

Jon Snow: The King of the North Jon Snow or Aegon Targaryen Either using his former name if independence in the North is achieved or the latter if he ends up in a marriage with  Daenerys Targaryen. He will be the main opponent to the Night King and it's possible he will slay the Night King on the battlefield. Jon will definitely survive the game of thrones.

Sansa Stark: Sansa Stark will rule Winterfell and become the Head of House Stark as Jon Snow is ineligible to become the head of the house. Sansa is no fighter and will mostly remain as a political figure managing the North's safety from the incoming White Walker threat. Sansa will be with Arya as more of a background figure in the main events.

Bran Stark: Bran will act as the rook for the Stark family. He is not the most important piece but he can be immensely helpful in securing victory. Bran will be useful in facing the White Walkers but I would say 50% of him living till the end.

Arya Stark: Arya has come along way with a lot of character development but she doesn't seem to fit in any role, her apparent usefulness is lacking as she is neither political or a good leader which is critical in this finale season. I don't see her doing much but she will survive in the end.

House Lannister-

Cersei  Lannister: Cersei is the current Queen but she has too many enemies and not enough allies with her forces depleted and resorting to buying mercenaries that number a few thousand will not keep her alive. She will die not by anyone but her own brother's hands-not Tyrion...Jaime. Tyrion may want to kill his sister but it will be Jaime that deals the killing blow to his sister and lover.

Jaime Lannister: Humbled in the years since the start of GOT he is like a different man than he used to be. He will see the White Walkers as a bigger threat than any game of thrones that Cersei likes to play and in the situation will end her life. Jaime will survive the events and assume the head of House Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister: Tyrion is a man both conflicted and troubled. His own family excluding Jaime bear him no love and he has allied himself with the enemy Daenerys Targaryen. He shall have to choose family or friends and him choosing either could either leave to life or death something that he has stated multiple times he wants to live. I do believe he will survive and become Hand of the King/Queen

House Greyjoy-

Euron Greyjoy: Euron will remain on the Salt Throne. His boasts and taunts to both enemies and allies alike will prove him to be close to death yet he shall remain as ruler of the  Iron Islands. He will kill Theon and Yara Greyjoy.

Theon Greyjoy: Theon is a cockless man with support from about a dozen Ironborn raiders(from that fistfight) after his sister was taken captive.  I doubt he poses a major threat so long as no one helps him and as long as Daenerys doesn't burn down the Iron fleet or kill Euron I doubt Theon can do much of anything but die.

Yara Greyjoy: Yara Greyjoy will be killed by Euron. She will be kept in a dungeon and pose no threat to Euron but in the event, Theon tries to rescue her will be killed by the guards.

House Clegane-

Sandor Clegane: The Hound still has unfinished business with his brother. Sandor's story culminates in the fight and killing of his brother Gregor. It will be in the North the fight happens between them.

Gregor Clegane: The Mountain will be reanimated by the Night King. No longer Qyburn's project he shall rampage across wherever he is at the moment

House Bronn

Bronn-Gets Gold, Women and Castles

That's my predictions for Season 8. Do you agree or disagree share your thoughts? I'd make a Tl:Dr but I'm getting bored of writing so much.",1
"So we know that hodors death being experienced in his past self made him have the seizure, and while he didn't go mad, it definitely messed him up. I dont remember exactly where it is but there is a scene where bran is looking into the past and it is alluded that aerys and the white walkers are linked. I'm thinking that the three eyed raven was involved with him going insane and the reason he wants to ""burn it all"" is because he is afraid of the white walkers coming.

"Many people are saying that seasons 5 and 6 were bad. Opinion Alert! I disagree.

1. 5 and 6 had 10 episodes.

2. The timeframe was normal. No jumping 2 months in a 5 minutes. 

3. Sure there was alot of crappy Fantasy, but they had a healthy ratio of Politcs as well.

4. It still felt like the Game of Thrones we love. 

&#x200B;

However, Season 7 was the worst season I have EVER seen on television. So many plot holes bug me. In Ep 4 and 5 why didnt the writers make Dany capture Jaime so that he could be brought beyond the wall as a witness of the dead to tell Cercei? In Ep 3, how did the Lannisters take Highgarden without seige weapons? Wasn't there a massive Tyrel army? And of course Ep 6 was the worst. Way too many fake deaths, with Jon falling in the water and Jorah almost falling off the dragon. Who do HBO think we are, 10 year olds? If Season 7 was longer, the story could have been better explained. It is almost unbearable watching. I cringe at every time jump. 

&#x200B;

Hopefuly Season 8 will listen to the fans and be better.

EDIT:

Also 7x6 was just a CGI, cliche fantasy shitshow. The whole stupid expedition could have been simpler if the writers made Dany capture Jaime and bring him beyond the wall as a witness to Cercei. Jorah falling off the dragon, holding on to someone's hand; I've seen similar scenes across hundreds of different movies and TV shows. Jon falling into the water fake death? Perfect waste of time. Uncle Benjin shows up for like 10 seconds just to die? WTF.

Was all of Season 7 shit? No. But now it's more of a fantasy show. If I wanted fantasy, I could watch LoTR, which does fantasy better. No, most people (Me included) love GoT for it's political storylines. S6 was a bit more fantasy than the previous seasons but it had a healthy mix of fantasy and politics. Season seven however: Oof.",1
"I don't think I'm emotionally equipped for a Jon and Arya reunion...it might well be too much for the cold, heart-shaped void in my chest.",1
"I've seen a lot of people complain that Season 7 is the weakest of the whole series. I really didn't have much of a problem with it, I enjoyed the sense of things finally coming together and the dread of the long-fabled winter finally arriving. That being said, yeah, it had some pretty weak moments >cough ice lake cough< and the dialogue isn't quite what it used to be. Other than that, though, I think I'm satisfied with the direction things are going and I'm anxious to see how it all ends. 
If you feel the same way, what are you looking forward to in Season 8? 
And if you weren't as happy with S7's turns and changes, what do you think should happen that could bring the show back to its former glory?",1
That Jon should've given karhold and the last hearth to other northern houses.,1
Throughout the series it is showcased multiple times that bastards are extremely disliked and treated as scum and I was wondering why? Why hate the child when it's not even their fault? Shouldn't all the blame fall on the cheating parent? And if so have there been any repercussions on these parents because so far I have not seen any punishments for those who participate in infidelity.,1
"So I was wondering, considering the fact that the Karstarks are the only, to my knowledge, remaining cadet branch of Stark family, or at least the most powerful, shouldn't they capitalize off their claim to the Lordship of the North? At some point post red wedding, once the Boltons had solidified their claim to winterfell and are now trying to consolidate loyalty from the other northern houses, Ramsay Bolton says that the Umbers, Manderlys, and Karstarks command more men than the rest of the northern houses combined. Now the Boltons, being the historic rivals of house Stark, would also be somewhere within this top 3, but this would still leaves the Karstarks at LEAST the fourth most powerful house in the North. Due to the lore in the books, it is known that the Karstarks are direct descendants from a member of the Starks family, Karlen Stark, who was given some land and his own keep, naming it Karhold and his family branch would come to be known as the Karstarks. This officially makes Lord Harrion Karstark, Lord of Karhold, at the point of the Red Wedding, the man in the whole of the Seven Kingdoms with the most Stark blood (Stark-iest, if you will) that isn't presumed dead/a sworn brother of the nights watch AND a bastard/essentially a prisoner in kings landing.

So because the Karstarks have a pretty big army as it is, and the best claim to the northern throne in the seven kingdoms (other than bran and Rickon, who are presumed dead), it would stand to reason that a substantial amount of northern houses would come to their aid in a possible northern civil war. Not that it would be much of a war anyways, as the Boltons may have some historical allies, they certainly can't fend off an army of, presumably, tens of thousands of northmen fighting for who they believe is there rightful leader. 

“The north remembers” they say, and I don't believe in this case they're any less likely to do so. 

In the end, I never read the books in full, so I was just wondering if there was some answer in there as to why exactly the Karstarks didn't challenge the Boltons after the extinction of the starks.",1
Why does Jon want to hide his being killed and ressurection from Danaerys? ,1
"Davos learns that Shireen was burned by Melisandre. He calls her out in front of Jon. It's a very well acted scene. I'd describe the scene itself as powerful. I'd describe the emotions as raw. But I don't think it's anywhere near as good as everyone has made it out to be.

It's rightfully the point in the story worth remembering because that whole sequence finally reaches its payoff from setting up Davos and Shireen's relationship. But acting talents on this show (IMO) are best expressed in subtleties and buildups. Stannis slowly but steadily declines into unhinged madness. We see the journey of a resolute man doing whatever it takes to save the world and stake his claim. But each and every step of the way, Stephen Dillane delivers on this descent into the abyss. You can even see the rationalization seep out of his face as he sets his new course.

I just find those moments much more noteworthy of brilliant portrayals rather than the explosions of emotions and climaxes that are supplemented and amplified by their overall context.",1
"Did Jon meet his match with Karl Tanner? I look back at all of Jon's one-on-one fight scenes and the only person he seemed to have a lot of trouble with was Karl, in fact he seemed completely outclassed by him. Craster's girl sneaking in with the knife was nothing short of a miracle.

&#x200B;

I've asked around and a lot of people claim that Jon was at a disadvantage with a long sword inside a tent, but if you're an elite fighter like Jon, you've clearly figured out how to use your preferred weapon in any circumstantial setting. Jon knew what he was getting into stepping inside that tent.

&#x200B;

All in all, Karl was an extremely skilled fighter for a dude who spent all his time in a cabin getting drunk and raping women. I'm surprised we saw so little of him.",1

"I'm rewatching the series (again) and I noticed something I hadn't notice before. I don't know if anyone has pointed this out before, but in season 3 episode 10 Bran tells the story of the Rat Cook at the Night Fort. The night's watch cook who served a king a pie filled with his own son, as punishment the Gods transformed the cook into a white rat that would feast on his young, forever hungry. However, the Gods did not punish him for murder but rather for killing a guest in under his roof. Obviously, this is following the Red Wedding and this is alluding to Walder Frey murdering guests under his roof. When Arya takes revenge on Walder Frey she feeds him a pie of made from his sons, he was forced to feed on his young as punishment for murdering guests under his care, just like the Rat Cook. 

TLDR; Walder Frey is the Rat Cook being forced to eat his children out of punishment. ",1
"I've watched the new GoT teaser several times trying to figure out what it all means because I'm not convinced it's as pointless as others seem to think it is. 

And I've been a little disappointed in the lack if fan theories based on the teaser.

So, here's my prediction for season 8 based on the trailer: 

The show will confirm a theory that The Great Other (the god of darkness, cold, evil, fear, and death) is imprisoned in Winterfell's crypts and that when the Starks left, the Others began raising an army of the dead so they could basically invade Winterfell and break The Great Other free. Whatever magic was used to imprison him basically dragged the Stark children all back to Winterfell. And here's where I'm a little more uncertain. 

We know there must always be a Stark in Winterfell and part of this theory about The Great Other's imprisonment is that Stark blood was used in a blood magic ritual to imprison him there. So, their presence will either re-strengthen whatever enchantments are binding him to Winterfell or the Starks were gone for too long and he will break free no matter what, but the Starks (and Daenerys and her dragons) are the only ones who stand a chance of trying to resist the Others when they invade Winterfell to break their god free.

The statues in the trailer make a lot of sense with this theory too. Some people are speculating that this scene doesn't happen in the show and others are saying it's a dream (which is entirely possible because there are lots of dreams about the crypts in the books). The only manifestation of his power that we've seen comes from the Others/White Walkers, so we don't really know what he can do. I have a hard time believing he would evoke fear in the Starks by showing them statues of themselves because it seems like he could do significantly more based off what we've seen the Others do, but the statues do represent death and they could make the Starks afraid because most people are afraid of death. The crypts are filled with icy air after they see their statue. Nevertheless, I'm not completely writing off that The Great Other is showing them these statues. At the very least, if this scene will occur in the show as a dream, it could definitely be interpreted as foreshadowing the release of The Great Other.

And we see basically everything The Great Other controls in the trailer. We see death (or, more accurately, a foreshadowing of death) which creates fear. We see icy air invade the dark crypts. I'm not sure the trailer directly shows us evil. But, when the ice fills the crypts, we know the dead come with it. Not only does it hint at the ""evilness"" of the Others, but it could also be like a meta foreshadowing of The Great Other's release. He is, after all, R'hollor's antithesis.

Disclaimer: I don't read the books and most if what I know about The Great Other comes from reading other fan theories. ",1
"Fun thought experiment with my buddies. 

Personally, I got:

Point guard: Rob Stark (great facilitator)
Shooting guard: Night King (his aim is impeccable)
Small forward; Khal Drogo (great size but great speed)
Power Forward: The Hound (great size and not all that slow)
Center: Brienne (she's pretty damn big; close second was Hodor, but he lacks the agility that Brienne has)

"The witch was laughing the whole time and that seemed strange to me. Got to thinking and I was wondering if maybe its her pride that fulfills the prophecy not destiny and the curse that resulted from the witch was infact pride itself.  With her black armor, qybern as her hand, and zombie clegane as commander of the kingsguard. I would say an alliance between her and the night king is all but certain. Especially with the looming threat of John and Dany. I dont think she cares about her unborn child not enough to flee. Its pretty obvious the way she desperately clings to that throne. That meeting shouldve been it. She flys in on a dragon to the dragon pit and shes still stupid enough to call her a would-be usurper. Its over she extended a truce and her pride got in the way. If she keeps that crap up The night king is gona seem like the best option to her.",1
"Watching the seasons through a few times you can see the crazy influence Lord Baelish has on the whole story line.

I've seen people complain on this sub on how sudden his death was, and how he seemed careless leading up to it. This was out of character and the story line was getting rushed. I always disagreed.

I'm watching the seasons through again and while he was definitely very careful with how he planned everything, he took a huge risk killing Lysa in front of Sansa.

If Sansa had of just told the truth the lords of the Vale would have killed Baelish right then and there.

Yes his death was sudden but I feel that those moments are what makes Game of Thrones so great. I think at that point he felt invincible and could influence just about anyone.",1
"Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the throne. Here was a bastard, dejected and despised, cast aside. Jon, by the virtue of his morality, fairness and courage, worked his way up. He, unlike so many other characters on the show, earned his power with grace and trust. What an incredibly powerful message.

Oh, but by the way, he was the king all along!

It just seems lame and takes away so much from his journey in my opinion. I had lots of problems with season 7, but this major misstep can't be blamed on the showrunners , as it was GRRM's plan all along.

"If we assume the Targaryens are the rightful monarchs of Westeros, the line of succession would have gone from the Mad King, to his oldest son (Rhaegar, killed in battle), then to Rhaegar's children (murdered by the Mountain) then to Viserys (Dead) then to Daenerys just like the show and books show. However, we now know that John Snow is the legitimate son of Rhaegar which would have bumped him up in the line of succession before Viserys and Daenerys, but Rhaegar and his other children died before John was born, so you could argue that when John was born the crown had already rightfully passed to Viserys and would then go to Daenerys before John or since that never happened John is in the next in line behind the Mad King.

So the question is, who has a better claim to the throne, John or Dany? If Westeros if following british rules, would an unborn child trump a younger sibling? Are there any real world precedents for something like this or could this end up being whatever the Westerosi equivalent of a constitutional crisis?",1
"1. Dany will die. Possibly killed on her dragon in battle. BUT before that she has a baby with Jon or someone else.

2. The people of Kings landing will revolt against Cercie.

3. Jon will become the
reluctant King of the seven kingdoms. He will hold the throne until Dany's child comes of age. 

4. Bran is the night king and Arya has an epic battle with him, they both die.

5. Sansa and Jon are the only Starks left at the end.

"I have been giving some thought to the prophecy that says two kings dying in succession can wake a dragon. I have seen many theories by fans regarding whether Jon is also a human dragon. I think he is after his resurrection, and here is WHY:

""Two kings to wake a dragon. The father, and then the son, so they both die kings.""

Melisandre has been trying to (mistakenly) wake (actual) dragons by trying to use/sacrifice (in both books and show) a child of Robert. But both Edric Storm (in the books) and Gendry (in the show) are BASTARDS. Their father's death does not make them kings and THAT is the main part of the prophecy. It takes TWO KINGS. 

 Both Melisandre and fans have been too obsessed with the ""father and son"" bit and lost the crucial ""both die kings"" bit. I have seen theories about Jon's grandfather and uncle's deaths on his mother's side counting for it, but no, they were no official kings, even though their ancestors were. 

The show might have messed this up a bit with Daenaerys for one and her 'human dragon' abilities of resisting fire. The show kinda hints at it from the beginning. But there's no indication of it in the books. I believe she became/'woke' as a dragon by the ritual of the priestess only following the deaths of Drogo and his son, thus 'king' and 'heir' (I have seen it being argumented that Drogo died after Rhaego but Drogo WAS dead; the witch just brought him back as a spiritless carcass, he wasn't truly alive anymore). And so she was 'woken'.

In Jon's case, yes, Rhaegar's and Aerys' deaths don't count for it, bc Rhaegar died a prince. BUT-

I don't know what the show did with that, bc I didn't watch that season, but in the books, before going to the Twins, Robb's wife was not pregnant (tho I know she was in the show so they messed shit up again) and he thought all his other siblings were dead. He was worried about not having an heir. And so he called a meeting. And he made everyone sign an official document that, in the event of his death with no children, Jon would be released of his vow, legitimatised and declared king/his righteous heir. Bc Robb was a king, he COULD do that, yes. Maester Aemon would've been freed of his vow before him and become king had he accepted it.

Of course, shit went downhill after the Red Wedding. BUT, by all official matters, Jon was made heir of the North throne\ presumed king by law. But THEN he died, too. Thus, Robb/the king and his heir/presumed king died, both technically dying kings. A ritual would then ""awaken"" Jon, also of Targaryen blood, so also capable of being a woken dragon.

""Two kings to wake a dragon"". The explanation why Daenaerys has her powers of all Targaryens, and possible proof that Jon will be another 'dragon'.

(Also this being a Targaryen thing bc of their connection with dragons might explain so many Targaryens' obsession with it. It has been possible for them before, as well, but at great costs.)",1
"So I'm on the Jon and the Night King die boat.   I haven't seen much trying to predict their deaths but I think they are going to fight and ultimately kill each other.  How?  A repeat of history where Jon and the Night King are fighting on dragons, but at some point the two collide.  Jon leaps off of Rhaegal onto Viserion, stabbing the Night King.   After the collision Rhaegal and Jon fall to their deaths.  Dany and Drogon are unable to help Jon and Rhaegal because (insert D&D reason here).  This will mirror the events from the [Battle Above the Gods Eye](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_Above_the_Gods_Eye).   Maybe this actually occurs over the Gods Eye since we see the ice and fire meet there in the first trailer we got this year (I think it's called Dragnstone).

&#x200B;

I think this could be visually stunning and emotional for the audience.  Imagine watching Jon leaping in air and as he kills the Night King and an ice explosion occurs.  Grounded characters see wights and wight walkers collapse/die but then  they look up and see Jon and Rhaegal falling out of the sky.  Each character would have their own reaction to this as the camera sweeps across the survivors.  Picture Arya and Davos sprinting towards Jon, while Sansa and Dany just cover their mouths in shock.  The last image we have of Jon is him closing his eyes just before he hits the ground, accepting his death.  Dany cannot save Jon, that would be too cheesy and would go against what GoT is supposed to be.  Emotionally as the audience we will (most of us) be happy as the Night King dies, but then we realize that the hero is making the ultimate sacrifice. Thus a bitter-sweet ending to the war against death. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Jon and Night King kill each other by events like the link above.",1
"When Meera left Bran it never sat right with me, not due to the rudeness of the three eyed ravBran but instead at how it didn't really make sense. Meera and Jojen went north on their fathers wishes and they went to find Bran. They knew that Bran was the key to winning the war as Jojen had stated. She out of every living person knows that Bran must survive for the Long Night to be won yet she decides to leave the crippled boy with family he hasn't seen in years and other dodgy characters around. He is the true born heir to Winterfell and if someone wanted him out of the picture, which they well could, he's an easy target. But Meera left and her excuse: 

**I don't want to leave you, but when-- when they come, I need to be with my family.
And you're safe**

I have been thinking about it recently and here are my thoughts. Go back to the first tower of Joy scene and we see Bloodraven introducing Bran to who is there. He clearly says out loud that Howland Reed is Meera's father, something that you'd think Bran would know already. But I am starting to think that Bloodraven wasn't speaking to Bran but to the audience. So the audience, well casual viewers are reminded about Meera's father and then they know that Meera is with her family. Meera is with Howland and if you are like me and think we haven't seen the end of her then it will be **Meera bringing Howland into the mix** 

**Why**

That's the question. What part does Howland play. Well he was there when Jon was born so he is the last living person who knows but is that his role? Will an old Crannogman's opinion be enough to convince everyone that Jon is Targaryen. Maybe he will just reveal to Jon, but why? Sam and Bran can do that fine. Well realistically I think that could be his role in the show but I had another thought, I dawned the tin foil: 

**DAWN - He will bring Dawn to the North as Dawn is Lightbringer**

Now IF Lightbringer is to appear, I don't even really think that it will to be honest but IF it is then it can't be a Valyrian steel sword. We know that Lightbringer was forged 8000 years ago in Westeros, long before the Valyrians had any influence in Westeros, maybe Lightbringer was crafted into Valyrian Steel eventually or maybe Dawn, the sword that is different than all others and just as sharp as Valyrian Steel. 

The book says a member of House Dayne followed a falling Star and Dawn came from it and then Ned left it to Ashara Dayne. There is no mention of that in the show so there is some license here to work with. Howland killing Arthur Dayne was strange and didn't make any real difference to the story, unless of course Ned gives the sword to Howland because it was Howland who killed Dayne and not Ned and since then Howland has had the sword and will be shown the importance of it. 

**Disclaimer**

I am not even a big follower of Lightbringer being in the show, I know this theory isn't flawless and it's more brainstorming from me than anything else but I am convinced that Meera will return, I think the mention of her family and Howland will mean that he will be in the next series for sure and I know that there is a good chance it's just to reveal to Jon in the books at least I think he will be the one to reveal. But with the reveal already covered by Sam and Bran there must be more to Howland Reed's potential appearance than that. 

A point was made of showing Dawn on the screen and it hasn't been revisited yet, I think that Howland Reed could have the sword or even more than that knows where it is **cough cough** Crypts of Winterfell **cough cough** sorry I had something in my throat there. 

I am not even sure I am correct but I do think my line of thinking has narrative sense to back it up and you just never know. Guess we will find out in June. I hope anyone takes time to read this and hope you like it as much as I liked writing it



**Edit: Bonus: Lightbringer the sword that helped Azor Ahai and as the prophecy says he will pull the sword from the fire ""and the darkness shall flee before him"", the Long Night so night time what makes the darkness of night flee? Dawn. Dawn brings the Light, Lightbringer**",1

Jeor- When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, you think it matters who sits on the iron throne?

Jon- No

Jeor- Good, because I want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the wall tomorrow. 

Jon- beyond the wall?

Jeor- Ill not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. I mean to find out whats happening. The nights watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the white walkers, and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. I will command them myself, so Ill only ask you once, Lord Snow: are you a brother of the nights watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?

"Is there any theories or ideas on the repetition of the line ‘I wish you good fortunes in the wars to come' it crops up like 3 times by 3 different characters at quite important moments; it's definitely going to come up again this season, but it must mean something right? ",1
"**EDIT: She will watch all of the show, EVERY single episode., It was just looking for specific episodes that I can jump in with her to see her reactions.**

so through the past few years i have been re-watching my favorite films together with my S.O., who hasn't watched any of them (like LOTR, Star Wars, MCU, etc.). Her reactions to those plot-twists, deaths, epic, heroic goose bump inducing moments so far have been entertaining to me, worth sitting for hours and re-watching the movies again just for it.

I reckon Game of Thrones will surprise her the most, considering she hates deaths and always expects that plot armor will save main characters, and just how likable most of the characters are.

We don't have a lot of time together and watching every single episode with her will take ages, and we would like to watch the last season together. So my idea is that she watches most of them by herself and we only watch a few of it together, like season finales, maybe a random episode to occasionally throw her off.

What do episodes do you think are worth watching the reactions of people for?",1
I think mine is really unpopular. In episode number 7 Dany and John sleep with each other and I saw several reactions to this scene and the majority was happy about it. Tbh I can't find this in any way positive. I was sad 😂 or I am still sad/angry about it 🤷🏽‍♀️ I just don't like this at all,1
"Hi you guys,
 I am currently rewatching the series and I just have to discuss with someone, so what do you think the each house/characters biggest mistakes have been? Like the Starks (Robb) trusting the Frey's and Bolton's or trusting Theon. I'm just curious to see everyone's opinions. ",1
"The first time I watched through, my friends made me watch with them, so they could see my raw reaction to everything. I recently started to watch with my brother who had no prior knowledge regarding the show, so far (halfway through season 2) seeing him piece things together and get his reaction to things has been awesome.

What are some of your favorite episodes to watch with someone whose never seen the series before?
What were some of the best reactions to said episodes?? ",1
"She can't watch animals being killed or brutalized, so I need to know what scenes to skip. I remember S01E02 they kill Lady. Any other scenes I'm forgetting (and do you know the season/ep number)? Everything else is OK she's just totally sensitive to animal killing/abuse in particular.",1
"Watching the Game of Thrones for the hundredth time in anticipation of the new season and noticed a scene with Bronn and Sandor.

Setting: Bronn is in a brothel enjoying the company of a hoore with his gold cloak comrades when Sandor walks in, they exchange words and a drink and things start getting heated. They discuss their love for women and wine but Sandor claims that Bronn love killing ""same as me"".

&#x200B;

Don't know why but this gave me chills. Here you have two wild cards, they serve a master for vastly different reasons and no reason at all. Gold, prestige, wine, hoores, sure, but they love killing, they're along for the ride. Never noticed how similar they were before. During the conversation, they're both anticipating some violence, as they are on the cusp of the battle of blackwater bay.",1

"When people talk about what the saddest scene is,  i think everyone leaves out when you think theon has burnt the stark boys to death. 


In this scene i cried uncontrolably but in things like the red wedding and ned's death,  i didnt feel very sad. 

I am my reason for this is that the boys are so young and innocent,  wheras ned was told not to trust little finger,  and he was kind of annoying.
For the red wedding,  it is that a betrayal was very expectable, and rob should have seen it coming. 

Just wondering what you guys think the saddest moment was and giving my pick.",1
"I have only read the first book but have seen all 7 seasons of the TV show. I'm reading the books now because the story has gripped me and I hear there are details not shown in the TV show. My question though is this:

Would Bran still have encountered the Three Eyed Raven if he had not been injured?

Theoretically speaking, he would've gone to King's Landing. What then? ",1
"I don't know if this is one of the existing theories, but it came to my mind so I wanted to share it with you.

The Night King wants his Night Prince/Princess that was promised to take him/her up to the lands of always winter. The men will first lose the battle of Winterfell and then Cersei/Daenerys conflict will happen and Night King will rise all the dead they leave behind...  Daenerys will be killed in that major fight at the Isle of Faces/King's landing. Jon will use the same technique as Children used on Benjen and will stab her through her heart with a piece of dragonglass. This will revive her and she will leave far north with NK to become the Night Queen and give birth to her and Jon's baby (prince/princess) which will one day become the next Night King. Jon will become the ruler of 7 kingdoms, with his dragon Rhaegal. Daenery's fire will become ice, the icy Snow will become the fiery Targaryen. They will again bring balance to the world of ice and fire.",1

Personally my favorite is Jamie Lannister. I think his development from the man he was early on and who he is now is great. Now he is a fan favorite arguably after being more hated than Cersei was at the beginning 

Can't go wrong with Jon Snow and Tyrion as well",1
"I know that there are already a lot of theories surrounding the night king but was it ever explained why the ""experiment"" on one of the first men by the children of the Forrest that resulted in the night king/white walkers failed? 

Seems like a big mcguffin to me to just have it as ""it just failed and turned against them"".


Could it have been that that the man they turned was a direct ancestor of the starks? And that their ""warg"" ability was something the children weren't aware of and that made the night king uncontrollable/turn against the children. 

His ability to control the undead could also be a form of warging. 

This might also explain why presumably cold hands/ benjen stark is still a wight with self control... 

Excuses me if this had already been discussed to death.

"## Do we have any indication how much time and resources it takes to produce a scorpion in their era?

I read that in medieval times a suit of armor for a knight cost as much as a house. If large wooden weapons are the same maybe they can't make hundreds of them. Maybe a few dozen max. And that doesn't consider the time to build.

\- Gods: This may not seem relevant, but it annoys me a little. Which God/religion is the real one? How come Both the Lord of Light be real (judging by the 'visions' in the flames, the blood magic, the rebirth of Beric and Jon etc..) as well as the Many-faced God (Jaqen H'ghar and the house of black and white along with the faceless men), as well as the Drowned God (Euron's 'baptism' where he drowned and came back to life).

\- Is Jaqen H'ghar the Many-Faced God or what? And why did he let Arya live instead of killing her while she was wounded and holding Needle against his chest? Why did he let her get away with it?

\- What's up with Qyburn and how the hell did he actually manage to 'zombify' and enhance the Mountain? Is he secretly serving a God? The Lord of Light or something? Im not sure why no one seems to be giving that attention, if he can wake up the dead and make them stronger than before, shouldn't that be talked about more?

\- When the Three-Eyed Raven told Bran that 'it was time for him to learn everything', why did he show him how Hodor became a 'half-wit'? Is there something important that i'm missing?

\- Why does everyone seem to be scared of Milk of the Poppy? Sounds stupid, but Jaime refused to drink it when he was getting his hand fixed, he prefered to yell out and endure the pain rather than drink a numbing drink? And Arya also hesitated to drink it when she was being treated by Lady Crane..

\- Benjen 'explained' how he was saved at 1:20 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkArs3vL8oU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkArs3vL8oU) he says that a white walker stabbed him in the guts and he was 'left to turn' ... and was saved by having dragonglass plunged in his heart? The fuck? First of all, if he was still considered a human, both these wounds would've killed him, and if he was turning (and judging by his looks, he already has turned for 40%), wouldn't the dragonglass shatter him as well, since it shatters white walkers?

\- Follow-up on Benjen, how the fuck did he get a flaming mace? Isn't that only reserved for people who follow the Lord of Light?

\- What the fuck did Podrick do to those whores?

I have more questions, but i'll leave it at this for now.

Thanks in advance",1

Mine personally is that stannis is alive and will come back at the end of the show to attempt to take the iron throne. What's yours?,1
"Sansa.
This is an additional post to my one about King Bran.  In addition to the weird skewed betting odds in Bran's favor that make no sense, it is odd that Sansa is so far down in the betting odds.  Sansa's whole arc is based on learning to rule so it makes sense that she would end up as a ruler - as Queen Elizabeth I.  Just based on her arc and where the books/ show are taking her, I'd say that she is the #2 most likely of the non-Targaryens to end up ruling Westeros.  (Oh and this has nothing to do with shipping.  Sansa would rule alone in her own right if it happened.)   ",1

Since the new prequel show is about the long night do you think the night king of the current show is going to be the same as the one in the prequel? And if so is it going to be the same actor from the current show ? Because i really liked the look of the NK in s4 and s5 espically at hardhome he was more intimidating than the new actor imo .,1
"I think all of us want someone to sit in the iron throne at the end of GOT and throughout the show we see dany and jon go through alot of obstacles in their life just to set them up for the throne and both of them want to build a better place under their rule, jon didn't say it directly but we sure agree if he is the king the world would be better place even better than dany's world but the problem here after the death of jon or dany if any of them ruled the children will rule after them and the children never going to have the hard life that their parents have been through to make them fit and thr kids are not like their fathers and some of them would be weak or cruel so the better world than dany seeks will go worse in a seconds after the rule of unfit son, and in GOT the history repeats it self in alot of matters because if we go back to the time of aegon the conqueror we can see that he was a great king after he ruled he only wants peace of the realm and everyone feared him and loved him at the same time but the moment he died his son aenys became king and he was weak and everyone knew that from his poor decisions that he made after the rule and alot of wars happened in his time and he died because of the stress that made him ill and he was only 34 years old, so the point is the throne does not mean peaceful realm no matter what because of the king's children that are unfit to rule and the circle will continue.

She's never watched the show and wants to catch up before the final season. It is a lot of watch time to catch up. Which episodes are the most nessasary and which can be skipped?,1
"All my friends shit on me for my deep love for Theon. I totally get that he murdered some farm kids and betrayed the Starks, but his storyline makes me so sad for him. 

Yes the Starks treated him well, but they and the other northerners always made comments that he wasn't part of the Stark family all throughout S1. (I always think of the scene where he saves Bran's life and Robb gets mad at him for doing it, saying it's not his family.) Then he went home and his real family basically despised him for existing. Not to mention he had his dick chopped off. I also felt like he redeemed himself by “saving” Bran and Rickon, saving Sansa, and (soon to be) saving his sister. 

I hate that he betrayed Robb and fucks up Winterfell but does anyone else out there still like him or am I just a weirdo?? I haven't found anyone else who has a soft spot for him like I do lol. ",1
"Im rewatching season 5 and I didn't really pick up on how depressed tommen became. He stopped eating when Margaery got locked up and then his mom got locked up and he literally just locked himself in his room and wouldn't talk to anyone.  
And Marcella kinda got sent off to some foreign city by herself as a little girl, and when she finally became comfortable with her future there, and had her first ever bonding moment with her real father, she gets poisoned for some petty revenge against her mom.

These two characters actually had potential in my opinion. I just think it's kind of a shame that they had to die off the way they did, right as we were getting to know them. They've been around since episode 1, I know they were really little kids but this season they finally started getting their own personalities. Idk, I just wish we could've seen a tommen-Marcella reunion, or that they were portrayed as well as the stark children. 
Just my honest opinion I suppose",1
"I've read a few theories here about Tyrion possibly betraying Daenerys. How far fetched is this theory? And for those that think it's possible, do you think he always had it in mind, or did he only start thinking about it after some of her more haste decisions he didn't agree with? ",1

"Random thought. In the S7 finale, during the big Dragon Pit meeting, Cercei says something that seems inconsistent. She agrees to the truce and asks Jon to stay neutral, and says something along the lines of ""I know Ned Stark's son will be true to his word"". 

This is odd because ever since Ned's death she has referred to him as a traitor & liar. Cercei obviously knows the truth that Ned was honorable and true, but she set forth a public narrative that he was a traitor.

So... is this a plot hole? Or is she at the point now where she just doesn't give a crap?",1

I now wonder if Bran was in control of Summer and ended up actually saving himself. When Bran first realizes he can control other living creatures he described it as feeing like a dream but more real. He always talks about dreaming of being in control of Summer while he is out hunting frequently. Just an interesting thought that came to mind! ",1

Now this is probably not a good representation of what all viewers truly think, but it just got me thinking that there is probably a range of opinion as to how good the next season will be.

If it's a son maybe Eddard, he did try to save Dany in season 1 but I doubt she'll ever find out. Aemon possibly, after the last Targaryen aside from Dany and Jon. Brandon too if he died in season 8. Rhaegar was already honored by the dragon so I doubt they'll name him that. 

Not sure what they'd name the child if it were a girl. Possibly Arya if she were to die, Lyanna, Daenerys, Cat was a bitch to Jon so no way they'd name their daughter after her.",1

"Is the way that they have butchered many of the characters. Some main examples are changing Euron from a creepy guy that actually has an interesting and weird aura to Cersei's pet. Or how they have screwed up Tyrion by making him go from badass dwarf to dwarf that makes one liners every other minute.

However my biggest issue with ruining characters is Arthur Dayne. I hate the Tower of Joy scene because of what they did to him. They got rid of his legendary sword “Dawn” and replaced it with two normal swords because a sword fight with 2 swords in the hand of one person is a hell of a lot cooler than one sword in the hands of a literal sword fighting god. 

I know almost all of you will disagree with me on this but I can't get over how poorly they did the Tower of Joy sword fight scene.",1

"Hi there game of thrones fans!

Some months ago I finished watching game of thrones myself. And like much of you here can relate I've watched way to many GoT theory videos on youtube. Now in order to prepare her for the final season, I finally got my girlfriend to watch the show. And I've been watching with her with some of those theories in mind. However, while we were watching just a random scene in a random episode a few things hit me at once, and I'm very curious what you might think about this endgame theory on Varys.

MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: only keep reading if you have seen everything from season 1-7

So I'm going to be assuming you as a reader are familiar with the most mean stream theories. Here is what I assume to be true: Tyrion is a Targaryen (Mad king raped his mother, Tywin knew) , Varys truly wants stability for the realm and the people, Jon is Aegon.

Now I would like to point out that Varys in the books talked about how he ""trained"" a perfect ruler. And to some people this seems to be either Jon, whom indeed is an amazing leader, or Danny, whom is growing stronger every day. But if Varys had the Iron Throne in store for Jon, where the hell was he, he never was around? Jon wanted some legitimacy and joined the wall for life, and nobody bothered to stop him. Strange.

And what about Danny? Varys left the capital in order to serve Danny better and supply her with advice(rs). However, when Robbert gave the order to kill the girl. Varys didn't object, he carried out the order, and when Ned called to cancel the assassination Varys didn't seem to be in much of a hurry. It was probably already done he said. Now it is possible that it was true at the time, as timelines don't have to be shown chronologically, however, it does raise some suspicion. What if it totally fitted Varys his agenda to have Danny killed, and he didn't mind at all? 

So I got thinking: what if, Tyrion is the one Varys has been grooming for the Iron Throne for the past 20 years? 

It makes perfect sense. Varys was around for Tyrion not for Danny and Jon. Jon was shipped off to the wall and Varys didn't bother. Danny was wanted dead, and Varys carried out the order. However, Varys was always there when Tyrion needed assistance, or aided him when he escaped death row. Also, Varys took Tyrion to Danny. He said in order to advice her. What if that was a lie, and he only brought him there to advice her so that Tyrion would get more experience at ruling? To get to know the lands of Essos? Tyrion is a smart and just man, totally fit for ruling. And I think Varys has more to do with that than Tywin did. 

To come back to the point earlier. Dannies claim to the throne is stronger. As she is a true born Targaryen. However, is Varys really the kind of guy to really care about that? Or does het just want to do what is good for the realm and put the best ruler on the throne? And if that is the case, how would he have reacted when Robert wanted her dead? The way he acted seems to perfectly fit this scenario.

Both Danny nor Jon never really have seen to get prepared to rule. However Tyrion has served as Hand of the King, Master of Coin, and has led men to battle. He understands diplomacy and is able to make the hard, selfsacrificing choices rulers need to make. It would be awesome if Varys was just preparing him, grooming him, only to reveal his true herritage only áfter the usurpors are dethroned. Before that it would be too dangerous. 

Okay, I could go on for hours about how many things are consistent with this theory, but I'm curious what you guys think.  Is this plausible? Is this even a new theory (It is very possible I missed it, not as up to speed anymore nowadays) Do i miss some epic implications of this? Is there something that disproves all of this that I'm missing? I look forward to what you have to say!

Now with a lightbringer sword he destroys the white army, whites being the Mass Effect style cure to the darkness brought on by man's inner greed.

"During the Shae Tyrion and Bronn scene in the scene of Battle At The Greenfork says that he has been beyond the wall for work.

Bran...  This is about the betting odds which are just weird.  Insider-betting is a possibility.  I personally will be because I find Bran boring as a character and sort of creepy and emotionless.  I'm against a Targaryen restoration but just find the idea of Bran as the all-powerful god emperor controlling everything sort of off-putting as an ending and way out of left field.,1
"I've been wondering why the last few seasons of the show did not work as well as the first few and I kind of have a season.

A very good writing technique is letting the world develop around the characters and have the characters react to it with their own unique personality. The show writers did the opposite where they made the world work around the characters. What do I mean by this?  Dany convincing all the Dothraki to join her after killing their leaders and walking out of a flaming hut, from season 1, it was established that the Dothraki hated magic. Instead of doing that, they could have had Dany make an impressioned speech about Dothraki not accomplishing shit in the last few decades and how she plans to make men from the far west fear the Dothraki. Less flashy but it would make more sense.

Another problem is that all the characters have now become tropes instead of characters. This is related to my first point. Arya is now one of the most bad ass assassin. Dany is a good and fair Queen. Jon is the white washed protagonist that can't be faulted. Sansa is the girl who suffered but learned the art of deception and ruling. See, during the first few season of Game of Thrones, we didn't neccessarily think that about these characters, our opinions of the characters and their trop changed constantly in the first few seasons. But in the last few, it has been static.

The third problem is that the show writers try to make it so every ""good"" guy likes each other for the basis that they are on the same side. Dany is now a fair and good Queen so every good guy has to like her. I'll make a bet with someone but I bet you that when Sam Tarly meets Dany, he'll forgive her on the spot and say something like ""I understand you did what you had to do"". In reality, people hold grudges, If you kill someone's brother who is dear to someone, they will remember, and even though Sam didn't get along with his father there is some relation there. It's not about whether Dany did the right thing or not in the grand sceme of things, to Sam, she killed someone he cared for. Why I think Sam will just forgive Dany is because something similar has already happened. Dany forgiving Varys and instantly trusting him after Varys sent some assassins at her. Arya and Sansa having their whole spat in season 7 and then LF happened and it's like the whole fight between them never happened. Their dispute was actually interesting and made sense. The point I'm getting is, is that the show writers are trying to say ""You should like this character, and to convince you even more, look at all these other characters that like this character"". In Game of Thrones fashion, many characters should still have disputes, the history of westeros is littered with some person sleighting another and then for the other person to take bloody revenge.

Sorry, I know some of you are sick of the complaints about the last few seasons. But in reality, many people have become less invested in the show, even the critics gave the last few seasons a weaker score.  I still like the show but I didn't bother rewatching the last 4 seasons.",1
"If Bran is the Night King (as a lot of theories suggest) is possible that the war against the white walkers will end easly: will be sufficient to kill Bran. It is sad and cinic to say that, but kill Bran (due to the fact he is sick) is far more easy than killing the Night King. Maybe someone among the good characters (probabibly a Stark) could realize that Bran is the Night King and, after a little bit of drama (“does it worth to save the world by killing my brother/a poor paraplegic?” “Yeas because he is not anymore Who he was: he is just the Night King!”) will kill him.

"My choice would be: Tyrion's second trial, Jaime's confession to Brienne, Oberyn talks to Tyrion before the trial by combat, Littlefinger and Varys ""Chaos is a ladder"" speech, Jaime and Tyrion's conversation (smashing the beetles).

These are the ones that come to my head, I am sure there are more. What is your list?",1
"This is going to be a somewhat unpopular opinion, and I hope it makes for some good discussion. Let me tell you before hand that I am not a Frey apologist, but rather a Stark fan. My goal here is to analyze the situation that led up to the Red Wedding a bit.

Walder Frey agreed to let Robb Stark cross the bridge when Robb's uncle Edmure was being besieged at Riverrun and needed urgent assistance. Walder Frey took advantage of the situation in a very sneaky way, thereby establishing one of his daughters as future Queen in the North.

When Walder Frey agreed to the deal, Renly Baratheon has already established himself in Highgarden, amassing a force of 100,000 men. Renly Baratheon was in a position that would have ensured a bloody war with the Lannister forces supporting Joffrey, thereby allowing the North and the Riverlands to split away from the Iron Throne. Walder Frey also knew that, considering Lysa Arryn was Robb's aunt, the Vale would either do nothing or take up arms for the Stark cause.

Joining Robb Stark was a safe bet at the time. When Balon Greyjoy started his invasion of the North (contrary to popular thought Theon was not the reason for this - at least in the books Balon was amassing a fleet for a long time already), and when Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell, confidence in Stark leadership in the North was shaken. Everybody knew that Robb had to deal with the Ironmen at some point, thereby exposing the Riverlands to further Lannister attacks.

When Renly was assassinated by the shadow, causing the Tyrells to defect to the Lannister side of the war, in turn causing Stannis to lose at the Blackwater, Robb Stark's fate was sealed. As Renly was dead and Stannis was militarily impotent post-Blackwater, Walder Frey had to expect a combined Lannister-Tyrell assault on the Riverlands. Robb Stark would have been busy fighting the Ironmen in the North, while this happened.

Walder Frey would have been beheaded as a traitor once the Riverlands fell to Lannister control.

**I think he did not have any other viable choice other than turning against Robb Stark.** The way he did it, first offering them bread and salt under his roof and thereby protection under guest right, and then killing them regardless, was highly dishonorable. No doubt about that, and I am not trying to justify that at all. I am merely saying that, in the mid-term, he would have turned against Robb Stark. And that leaves the following question: **Why didn't Robb Stark anticipate his betrayal, given the strategic situation of the war?** ",1
"He tells Jon that he has 6,000 men when they meet before the battle. Where are those 6,000 men from? Common northerners? There's no way the Boltons had that many allies.
Also, if they are just northerners, why would they fight for someone who is fighting against Sansa and Jon, the children of the Starks?
Might be a dumb question, just need some help understanding. ",1
"Wasn't  the gold that was going to be used to pay the bank attacked by the dragon? We saw the dragon burn some carriages during the attack in 7x4 I think. This could be a major plot point because cerci thinks she has paid back the bank and she thinks they will supply a army. But it turns out she didn't so the bank finds it is in their best interest to help against the great battle to hopefully win (a gamble) which is ironic and get back their gold. Because how else would they get it back if everyone is dead? It's in their best interest. Or maybe the great war finishes with jon winning etc etc and they have no men left, cerci didn't help. She goes in to finish it but in comes the gold banks army with the ships of that one dude to get their gold back. The fleet of men that went to go get the army have been killed as revenge. The gold bank sees cerci as the enemy for the vast debt and destroys her. ",1
"Ok. Had a really crazy idea, and I'm not even sure if this makes any sense, but I wanted to post it in case anyone else out there wants to think about it and further ponder...or speculate. Also, if there ends up being any truth to it- I don't want to be that person who says “OMG that's what *I* was thinking all along!” and not have any proof.  I am aware this is probably WAY far-fetched and therefore these ideas are mostly for entertainment value, but I wanted to share regardless. 

In the books, there's a lot of talk about warging, and skin-changing. There's a line in the books in which Varamir Six-Skins asks how can we tell if the man is warged into the beast, or the beast is “wearing the man”- something to that extent. Later on, on the show, we see Leaf shoving a dragon glass dagger into who we believe to be the first NK and turning him from human to White Walker. We don't see what happened before this. WHAT IF Leaf was really turning him BACK to his true form? What if he was WARGED into a human and was changed back to the NK (his true form) by Leaf against his will? What if the NK was the beast who was ""wearing the man""? 

Another thought: Eye color is mentioned very frequently in the book series. A common Targaryen trait is violet eyes. What if they are the descendants of WW's that are living almost parasitically via warging into humans? Don't red and blue make purple? Could a blue-eyed WW have warged into a red-eyed Targaryen ancestor and caused their eyes to turn violet? Could it have been instant, or could it have taken place over generations? We have already heard stories of humans pairing up with WW's (13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and the Night's Queen). Could this have happened to humans in other parts of the world, perhaps knowingly or unknowingly pairing with a WW wearing a human skin, then producing violet-eyed children? 

Final thought:  Targs have a history of being crazy. It is known. In the beginning of the series Old Nan states WW's hate anything with warm blood flowing through them. Taking my somewhat crazy theory into account- what if during the war, the WW's (as their bodies died) warged into humans, forgot who they were over time, and drove those humans crazy as a result? Could this explain the Targaryen propensity for insanity?Why are Targs associated with fire and heat? Is that what keeps the WW's inside them at bay?  

One more thing: They say the WW's were DEFEATED, but they never used the word killed. Could some of the original WW's have survived to stay in their true form, only needing human hosts to continue living? Maybe that's why Craster's babies turn to WW's at just the touch of The Others. Maybe that's how the WW's transfer/warg into them. 

No clue how to put this all together...but wanted to share.  Feel free to interpret any way you would like.  I'm not claiming I whole-heartedly believe any of this, I'm just passing time, wondering ""WHAT IF?"" while waiting for Season 8. Thanks for reading.

"So I'm looking through a few videos via YouTube.... and I keep hearing during the battles amongst dragon riders that there are rules. 

1.You can only bond to one dragon at a time. 

2. The dragon will only accept one rider until the rider dies, then will then allow a new rider.

3. The rider must have true Valyrian blood. For example, a Targaryan. 

Does this imply that the NK is potentially a Targaryan? Does his magic void this? Does his magic make up the difference? Or is it simply because Viserion has died and doesn't have any issue because he's a zombie? 

Idk just a thought. Maybe a clue hidden in plain sight? Let me know what you think ",1
"I happened to recently watch the TV series over again, I was very intrigued with Varys disliking R'hllor followers and magic as a whole.   


On 2 separate occasions Varys traded words with priestesses of R'hllor. The first time was with Kinvara and she asked him ""Should I tell you what the voice said? Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?""   


The second time was with Melisandre at Dragonstone and she said ""I have to die in this strange country, just like you.""

So my theory is Varys knows exactly what the voice from the fire said. I think it revealed his death to him or told him how he is going to die, hence why he seemed so shocked to find out Melisandre knew what it said. That could be the main reason for his hate of magic. Almost similar to how Jojen knew exactly when he was going to die and how.  


Im not quite sure how Varys's story will end but im open for all discussions.",1

"First of all, there will be spoilers and I don't know if someone has made the same theory before.
Second, sort of hopes someone proves me wrong. 

In season 6 and 7 the build up of two great and «good» houses has been shown. Targaryen and Stark. These two houses has been portrayed as the ones who will save the realm and make it prosper, but GRRM has said himself that he don't likes good endings where the hero(es) wins and everyone lives happily ever after. 

The Hidden Rise of Petyr Littlefinger Baelish.
Littlefinger told Sansa that he likes to play a game. A game where imagines what is the wors thing someone will do to him. When Bran quoted Littlefinger, he knew he was in trouble. 
In of the episodes before Sansa asked Littlefinger if he knew what the Faceless men were, and he answered only by reputation. We all know that is a lie, because someone who «cheats» death and can look like others is of interest to a person who have had an eye on the throne. 
So in one of the episodes in S7 we see him talking to a woman in Winterfell and gives her a coin. Probably a Coin of Bravos. Then on the trial, there are TWO options in which he escaped.

Option one: He learned from Jaqen H'gaar and faked his death. We have seen Arya «kill» Jaqen H'gaar and the she proceeds to take of his many faces. He then appears live and well. Littlefinger may have done the same.

Option two: The lady who was given a coin from Littlefinger in Winterfell copied his face and took his place on the trial. You may be wondering: «but you can only use the face to a dead person.» WRONG. In the same episode where Arya «kills» Jaqen H'gaar, she pulls of his many faces and stares at her own face and then Jaqen H'gaar appears. So we know some of the higher ranks of the Faceless can use faces to the living. 

If one of the two options is correct or a third option will be put to use, how will he succeed?
Littlefinger have been in the game for quite some time. So he knows how dangerous sitting on the iron throne really is, and he can't defeat all those massive armies. He will wait for everyone else to fight and he will corrupt the winner from the shadows. He will then continue to play the game and rule the kingdoms from the shadows, and everyone and everything will then be puppets to Littlefinger and rule in his own way. 

Doesn't seem so farfetched, right?",1

Him and his men would have died in the blast, so I don't understand the point of bringing him down to the chamber, unless it was purely for dramatic effect. Any thoughts?",1
"So, at one point Melisandre was seen as her normal self in the bath, without her necklace on

"Something that has been bothering me for time immemorial is the fact that there are certain houses in Game of Thrones that are just under appreciated and are far too hated to be blanked or appreciated by the fan base in general. As a serious fan of Game of Thrones and the Song Of Ice And Fire series I have found numerous houses that are far too amazing to get the ending that they have received. I love George RR Martin as much as the next Game of Thrones fan however there is a serious criticism that I must give.  
Houses that are uniquely cruel and are 100% Game of Thrones are some of the most squandered storylines in the entire series.  
My very favorite house that has been damaged the most  is House Bolton. The Boltons are uniquely cruel they are impressively power hungry and they are stuck in a limbo of uncertainty and Extinction. The Boltons have one of the most unique models and sigils in the entire series and yet they are treated as though they were just another villain that happened to stop by. The same could be said about numerous other houses that are much more popular and bigger than the Boltons. Such as the Starks and the Lannisters. These houses have not so much been harmed by outside forces but have been harmed by either too much ambition or too little ambition. Similar things could be said about the Baratheons and the Tyrells.  
However this post is about houses that are mostly hated. houses like the Boltons, like the Lannisters and in my case like the Targaryens.  
I think it's about time that we as fans finally put aside the idea that we can only focus on houses that we enjoy. I think it's time that we look at the more hated and awful houses in the series not only for inspiration but for admiration as well.",1
"I haven't heard much of any talk about Essos In the endgame.. 

Does Winter come in Essos? Why don't they just go to Mereen and build a larger army there? Obviously it goes against the show and the interest of having a great batter for Westeros, but surely there must a logical reason for them not to go there. 

And if the WW and AotD take over Westeros, would they go to Essos next? ",1
"Mance offered Jon Snow peace in exchange for passage south of the wall.  Stannis offered the same, and pardons, citizenship, land, etc. except he also needed them to fight.  Except he specifically wanted Mance to bend the knee. Which Mance refuses to do.

However, if the original offer to Jon had been made and they were allowed south of the wall before Stannis showed up (or even if Stannis never showed up).  Did Mance expect to remain a separate king and the free folk to take land from others for themselves?  Or did he plan on his people becoming citizens of Westeros, and thus being subordinate to the Iron Throne?

My point is that either way, unless Mance Rayder wanted to seize land south of the wall and try to set up a separate kingdom, he would have had to acknowledge the ruler on the Iron Throne (or in other words, he'd have had to bend the knee, at least metaphorically if not physically as well).

And if that's true, why would he be willing to live in someone else's kingdom one minute but then when Stannis shows up he won't do it?

"Okay, so there are two known ways to kill a white walker, Dragon glass and Valyrian Steel. The white walker army is coming fast and Jon goes to Dragonstone to talk to Daenerys about mining Dragon glass. Bran is in Winterfell by the end of season 7. The army of the dead is coming fast and Bran knows that more than anyone. It would make sense that the day he came back he should use his powers as the three eyed raven and try to work with blacksmiths to forge Valyrian Steel so they can mass produce it in Westeros. Yeah, it could be really expensive and hard or impossible to make but they should at least try. There are probably less than 10 known Valyrian Steel swords, so even doubling that would make the war a lot easier to fight. This could still happen in season 8, but it should've been his first priority as soon as he got back to Winterfell because it doesn't look like they have a lot of time.

TLDR: Bran should find how to make Valyrian Steel in order to fight the army of the dead.",1
"Probably not an accident that Valyrians crafted weapons that could survive contact with WW weapons. And of course, kill them as well.

Are there any theories that attempt to explain the connection?

As a random guess, maybe the Valyrians were descendents of the First Men who abandoned the continent and took the risk of controlling dragons to prevent Essos from also falling into ruin. This would help explain both the affinity for dragons and the unusual properties of their swords.

"My understanding is that the Kingsguard are responsible for the protection of the monarch and his/her family. With only seven members this seems rather unrealistic. King Robert had three children plus Cersei meaning 7 guys had to protect 5 people around the clock. 

In addition we see Prince Joffrey with his own bodyguard, the Hound, who is not a KG at that time. Plus, we see a few scenes where Queen Cersei is accompanied by Lannister men-at-Arms (power is power scene) and not Kingsguard.

What's the deal? Surely in reality the Kingsguard should be either much larger like a Royal Guard or else only protect the monarch, with additional knights for other royals? ",1
"It's an odd question i know,but i recently reread ""A Class of Kings"" and was reminded of how much i love the Theon chapter where she meets Asha. That whole chapter where you are introduced to this cool chick and you think it's just another random character,but then realise who she actually is was really cool. It was fun at many moments,serious at others,you learn more about the Ironborn and then the reveal was very unexpected. I normally don't like the Ironborn stuff that much but that was one of my favorite chapters of the whole second book.

Another great introductory scene was that of Tyrion in the show getting a blowjob and having a drink before Jaime comes in the room. It was funny,encapsulated Tyrion's personality perfectly and made him instanly likeable.",1

"I feel like I'm missing something on my rewatch. How was Margaery's initial arrest justified? Just because the one guy knew of Loras' birthmark on his upper thigh doesn't mean his accusation of her knowing is true, right? Outside of the tattoo and Loras attacking the guy, what he said about Margaery is still just word of mouth and honestly quite a ridiculous thing to arrest the queen for. 

Edit: I just watched this episode. I'm aware of the scene it took place in. I'm simply asking how it was sufficient evidence to arrest Margaery because some random person who slept with his brother says she knew. 

If that's the case why don't people just always accuse people/houses, maybe even the high sparrow of being gay and paying a witness to say they witnessed it. There would be literally no difference, except it's more ridiculous in this case because it's the queen. ",1

Maybe someone can answer this for me because I couldn't think of an answer. So I've been rewatching with my girlfriend and roommates and she brought up a good point. We all know Jons parentage but there was an inconsistency possibly in the show. “Why does Jon burn his hand at Castle Black if he's a Targaryen?” Is it because he's not a true Targaryen and is half stark? And then does that mean he can't ride the dragons? They brought up the point that Viserys was a true blood Targaryen and he burnt as well. Just wondering so I can help answer these questions. ,1

1: white walkers win. This could be one of the craziest endings in then history of television. Making the bad guys win could be about how the good guys dont always win.

Bad endings
1: If after eveything deanerys sits the throne. This might just be cause i dont like the character  but i also think its to textbook for a show like GoT.

"I have watched again all the seasons, I still don't understand why Jon is a Targaryen and a legitime son if he:

\-will have a child with Daenerys;

\-will die.

He has accomplished everything by being Ned Stark's bastard son: Lord Commander, King in the North, Daenerys' lover. There was no need to make him a Targaryen. Jon Snow has achieved the feat of being accepted by all for his merits despite his bastardy. He even being loved by a powerful queen. He could thus have united North and South by marrying Daenerys, having a child and so on.

Except no, George RR Martin has made Jon a Targaryen, Daenerys' nephew and a serious contender for the iron throne.

Why ?

Jon received a Stark education and incest is a serious sin. He is a man of honor, he surely can't abandon his honor, his morals and his education to continue a relationship with his aunt. If he can not lie to Cersei for the good of humanity, I imagine he can't continue a relationship with his aunt, especially if it has just begun. In addition, the author strongly denounces incest and reminds us of the problems that entails (madness ...). How can Jon & Daenerys have a child if we do not know what will become of him in 20 years?

Then, Daenerys always believed to be the legitimate queen. She killed people and took control of territories based on this right. If Jon has the same right, it's a problem. It calls into question her convictions, her decisions, her actions and her sovereignty. In addition, some people followed her thinking that. But if another pretender appears, there is a risk of division. Not to mention the fact that Jon & Daenerys do not have the same vision of things, nor the same education. We are not in a nice story where everything is resolved by love / magic. This is a story where the title is about the games of the throne. The Jon & Daenerys relationship is one.

George RR Martin said he did not want to write a story with nice heroes against nasty villains. But more a story with gray characters who are the heroes of their own story and who end up opposing each other such Hector and Achilles. Choose our side becomes difficult because we know the 2 opponents and we are attached to them.

Which makes me say that season 8 is going to be hard to watch. We risk seeing the 2 main characters to oppose even if they are both the heroes of their story and thinks they are right.

I will also add that when I hear the showrunners, Kit & Lena joking about a Targaryen baby in the season 7 comments, I tell myself there is a concern. They can not talk so openly about a future spoiler. Unless... it does not happen.

And finally, if he does not end up with Daenerys and has no children with her, why should he die?

Why is he a Targaryen then? If he is, it is to perpetuate his lineage. Whether he ends up on the throne or not, the purpose of his identity is that he has a descendant. As Jorah puts it by passing on to him LongClaw.

&#x200B;

The fact that Jon is a legitimate Targaryen makes me think that the Jon & Daenerys relationship is likely to end, that they will not have a child together and that Jon, unless he has a legitimate child with someone else, will not die. But I see so many people thinking the opposite that I wonder if I'm the only one thinking that.

What do you think ?",1
This maybe a dumb question but I have been thinking about it lately. If the living were to lose the battle against the White Walkers would they then try to travel beyond the narrow sea? I know in the show it's said they can't swim but if the white walkers hate the living wouldn't they want to try to bring winter to Free Cities?,1
"i have a question about shay, tyrion lannisters whore. did she play tyrion or did she really love him? tyrions minion reported that he sent her away in a ship over the sea (cant recall where but far away) however in the trial she lied for tyrions father, i thought he found her and forced her too but then she talked like she is very mad at tyrion for sending her away so i thought she lied there partly out of spite but mostly because tywin had her killed if she doesnt but a few episodes later she was fucking tywin :O so was she after the money all the time? 

she wanted to run away with tyrion at some point, if she was in it for the money how did she think it would go with a dwarf on the run? on the other hand if she really loved him how can she simply switch gears and condemn him to death AND look him in the eye at the trial :O ""uh you send me away? FOR MY OWN PROTECTION?! i know, i will lie for your father and get you killed and then fuck him real good!"" also how did she come back or did she never leave and tyrions minion lied?

"Whoops, reposting this because I messed up where the spoiler tag went in the title.

I've been seeing a lot of these, here's how I think it will end. This got a bit long, but I would be happy if you read it and wanted to discuss! I will warn you that I am long winded and I have not read the books, although I have some amount of book knowledge just from being on here and reading some wikipedia articles.

**1. Humanity will defeat the Night King. I think that either Jon or Dany will survive the battle, but not both**

They might both survive, but I just doubt it. I know people say that it's still been a tragic journey, etc, but I feel like if the show ends with the 2 (potential) chosen ones : 
-discovering/being reunited with their family 
-falling in love 
-having a baby 
-becoming king and queen

...that's just a little bit Happily Ever After to be the ending that's been hinted at. And even though they'd surely lose friends along the way and possibly even Bran, it feels a little too neat.

I will admit that since we don't know exactly how long the books will go past the fall of the Night King, there is some potential for them both to survive and run into reality to complicate things. Or maybe it really will end with them going off into the sunset together. But I can't help but feel like they're going to get boatsexbaby just in time to save its remaining parent from being ""A Targaryan alone in alone in the world"".

**2. I think Jon will probably be the one to die, between the two of them**

So it's not much of a leap to think that the fight against the Night King and his army is related to magic coming back into the world. And given the man of the Night's watch had betrayed his vows after seeing the White Walkers at the very beginning of the series, that's probably the one that came first. So I think that both of our two potential chosen ones got something magical to use in their war against the Others, and when they win they're going to have to give it back.

Sadly (at least for me, because I love Drogon and Rhaegal) I think that for Dany, that means she's going to lose her dragons. Odds are she'll lose them in the fighting, but they'll turn the tide of war for humanity first.

For Jon, he was sent back because he still had a mission- to defeat the Night King. When he's completed that mission, it's not such a stretch to think that his borrowed time will be up. So I think he'll fall but bring the Night King down with him.

It makes sense, in a way. The magic was brought back to fight the Others, and when they are defeated, the magic is going to go back out of the world. Of course I don't think they'll be that textually explicit about why Jon and the dragons die, but it makes a sad poetic kind of sense.

**3. Arya will take care of Cersei**

In my estimation, Jon and Daenerys are the main protagonists, but Arya has had a lot of focus for a reason. She's had a long journey to become both an assassin but still Arya Stark, and she hasn't really done that much with it. In the books she wasn't even the one to kill the Freys. All of the ""original 5"" at this point sort of have their endgame arcs clear, except her.

Bran's journey has been about learning to access his visions, allowing them to discover how to defeat the Night King (I'm not convinced that the NK is going to be anything other than an unknowable evil). I suspect Jon is the prince that was promised, he was the first to rally men against the darkness and he will strike the killing blow. Daenerys finally understands why she has her dragons and how to use them in defense of the realm instead of to conquer it. Afterwards, when she assumes the Iron Throne and decides what kind of world she wants to make, Tyrion will be at her side to guide her. And after all these years of being sickened and ignored by shit rulers, he's finally found someone worth serving, that will appreciate his talents and listen to his counsel as they try to imagine how to structure a better world.

So that's nice, all tied up with a bow. So where does Arya fit it? I admit that having her be the one to take down Cersei is still kind of weak tea, especially after they defeat the Night King. But there's something to be said for killing without honor, especially when it allows one mad woman to die instead of untold innocents to starve in a lengthy siege or burn with wildfire. And maybe there'll be another role for this version of Arya that will tie in better that I'm not even considering.

**4. There isn't going to be an Iron Throne anymore**

So in this part, talking about what I think is going to happen after the wars I'm mostly assuming that Dany and her child live, but Jon doesn't. I think that most of this could almost just as easily work with Jon and their child, though, if Dany turns out to be the one who dies. Or even with both of them alive.

I think that once their enemies have been struck down and it is time to rule, Dany (and Tyrion) will restructure power in Westeros. Instead of a single King holding absolute power, it will be shared.

They will give some portion of it to the lords, some portion of it to the small folk, but still retain a more limited monarchy with a different chair. Maybe even something where each kingdom is given equal representation on the small council.

It won't be a mummer's monarchy, to be certain- the Queen will still rule. But there will checks on her powers, and she will hold herself accountable to the people she governs. I think that Daenerys and Tyrion will realize that if she assumes absolute power, no matter what good she does with it during her lifetime, if there's still an Iron Throne in play then it just takes one shitty descendent to undo all of it. Jaeherys I was what, 2 generations away from the Dance of Dragons? The only way to create sustainable change is to change the institutions. And that means letting go of the Iron Throne.

I do wonder how much time they'll take/have to explore things like how they handle victory. I think it will be hard for Daenerys to give up power, regardless of how well she knows it's for the long term good of the Realm. Especially in the midst of mourning her dragons, she's going to feel insecure, voluntarily weakening her position.

Personally, I find that I'd be more interested in that part of the story than watching the epic fight scenes, but I'm probably in the minority. Regardless of who lives, who dies, or who ends up with what kind of throne, I think that rebuilding Westeros in the aftermath of the Great War and all the other wars is going to be a difficult business.

Some things seem easy- certainly I hope and expect that Daenerys will do away with the Great Council of 101 AC. Other things are more difficult. If Sansa Stark and the North sue for independence, does she let them go? If they do, who goes next? Who, if anyone, should be installed in the numerous vacant seats of the once great and noble houses of Westeros?

Does she try to keep the Dothraki in Westeros, knowing that it will be an endless struggle to contain them, or does she send them back to Essos where they will probably go right back to their old ways? Is there any way for her to ensure her continued vision in Mereen without her dragons?

I don't need or expect the show to address any specific one of these questions- just to acknowledge that it gets even harder once the wars are won, especially for a conqueror.

**5. It's time for the Age of Men in Westeros**

This one I'm a little hesitant about. I don't think the entire planet instantly drained of anything magical the second the Night King fell, especially in places like Old Valyria. But I do think that it's going to be draining out of the world, and in its wake will coincide a new era for men, where they can establish greater traditions than might makes right. I'm hesitant about this because it sounds just like Tolkien, and I feel like GRRM must surely have something planned besides that.

That said, I'm not sure how else this ends. At the end of the day as far as I can see it boils down to either:

1. Night King wins
2. Jon and/or Dany win and set up their kingdom in a way that preserves Targaryen Exceptionalism and starts the whole Fire and Blood shitshow up again.
3. Jon and/or Dany win and weaken the throne in order to move Westeros more towards a system that would be resilient against being subdued by an unjust monarch.
4. Humans win but all the likely candidates to take and hold the throne are dead, so Westeros devolves right back into 7 or more warring kingdoms, each with their own little lord that thinks this is his moment to seize power.

Anyways. I recognize that there are lots of other ways it could go, but I feel like this one is the most likely. I don't really like it though.",1
"Since it was announced that season 8 would have mostly 80-minute episodes, I've seen a lot of people getting very, very upset and entitled. Many people are kicking off, claiming that we've been misled, that these runtimes aren't what we were told to expect, and more. But there's one fact these people are forgetting; we were never told we would have a season of 2-hour episodes. Not once.

The only quotes I can find online state that some episodes may be feature length, and one that actually says exactly this; *“We haven't had that discussion yet because I don't know how long the episodes are going to be. Two hours per episode seems like it would be excessive, but it's a great show, so who knows?” Casey Bloys.*

And we *are* having feature length episodes. Two thirds of the episodes are as long as a movie each, albeit a movie that's on the shorter side of the scope. For a fantasy show with a cast, budget, and production scale as large as this, we should actually consider ourselves damn lucky that we're still getting this much despite the increasing scope of the show. This is a massive step up from the lengths of previous average episodes; pretty much a 50% increase.

I remember when this whole 2-hour episode thing started, and it's literally down to nothing other than fans taking that previous quote I mentioned, getting ridiculously over-excited with it, and creating their own expectation that we would have 2-hour episodes. This kind of thing needs to stop. It's a perfect example of people over-hyping season 8 to the point where it simply won't live up to our expectations, and this reaction has proved that.

Basically, I'm not entirely sure what the point of this post is other than to rant. D&D are getting so much shit right now from entitled brats who seem to be forgetting that they're still delivering us the biggest fantasy TV show that has ever graced TV. How about we start, I don't know, actually fully appreciating this amazing show and all the work that's gone into it? Sounds like a good plan to me.

TLDR: We were never actually told we would get 2-hour episodes - it's just some fans taking quotes out of context and building up unreasonable expectations out of over-excitement, spreading this all over the internet, then getting entitled when these unrealistic expectations aren't met.

Note: I included a spoilers tag simply because I've tried posting non-spoiler things on here before that have been rejected still for not having that tag.",1
"The war against the undead is going to have most nobles either killed or fleeing while they still can to Essos.

I don't think they can fight a two front war against the undead and trying to keep their yoke of oppression over the smallfolk.

Soldiers will riot after sending wave after wave to die for little or no effect.

How likely is for the Houses to keep feudalism going after the literal apocalypse coming their way?

If humanity wins, would the survivors try kingdoms again? Would they even be able to opress the masses?

My theory is that most survivors will be isolated from each other, kind of like city states that will develop a federation style government.

"We *do* know that the Qaathi had built cities in the Red Waste, which seems to suggest that this region has not always been a desert.

This eventually caused desertification to unfold, thus making the Red Waste into what it is today.",1

"I think the writers are going to give us an unexpected king and queen at the end of the HBO GOT story.  They'll take 2 characters that we don't expect and unite them as the king and queen.  Both characters will do something exceptional to justify their elevation to become king and queen.  My guess is Gendry will forge a dragon glass tipped spear and will launch it from another dragon killing device that Qyburn will build.  Gendry will kill the Night King's dragon during the great battle with the Night King.  

Arya will take the face of a White Walker so she can get close enough to the Night King to kill him with the Valyrian dagger.   Gendry's and Arya's marriage will unite House Stark and House Baratheon which will be acceptable for the Seven Kingdoms.  Daenerys and Jon will die in the battle so they won't be alive to become king and queen.  Since they are related anyway, that would not work out well for a marriage.  In addition, Daenerys marrying Jon would be too predictable and the HBO GOT writers will want to avoid that type of ending.     ",1
"I'm currently on yet another rewatch of S1. It occurred to me - when Robert orders the death of Daenerys, why doesn't he also order Viserys' death? He would have been the easier of the two to kill, considering he wasn't of importance to the Dothraki. I know Robert was concerned with Daernerys' unborn child, but at this point in the show it was Viserys - not her - who wanted the throne. If he lacked honour enough to kill one, why not both? ",1
"I think the meaning of jon, sansa and arya standing on front of their stone statues in the winterfell mosuleum means that in order to fight the whights and white walkers they must die and be reborn as Lady stoneheart was (in the book) and Jon snow was.

"So as we all saw when Littlefinger got sentenced to death Sansa told the room that it was him who killed Lysa. The Vale only followed him (and Sansa because of him) due to his marriage to Lysa. 

In Season 4 when Lysa died the Knights of the Vale were ready to kill little finger for her murder, the only reason they didn't is because Sansa lied for him and agreed with his story, that she did infact commit suicide.

We were shown before this how loyal the Vale were to the Aryn family, the Knights worshipped them and would do anything for them. They end up following littlefinger because he has a hold over Robin. 

Will these men honestly stay following the Starks now they have found out that Sansa played a huge part in covering up this murder? Can we even expect the show to cover this aspect of the plot? 

I am honestly interested in people's opinions on this matter, can we really say Sansa is coming into her own and learning to play the game when her first bold move will alienate one of their largest allies. Do you think the Knights of the Vale will stand by the Starks after this?

However I recalled that when fire and ice meet in the S8 teaser, it appears the location is at The Neck, and a wall of dragonglass forms. Some speculate this implies this is where the 'final stand' against the White Walkers will take place because of that, and also the Necks strategic geography. No one has been able to invade the North because of the Neck and Moat Cailin. Wouldn't it be fitting then to reverse this, and the White Walker's can't invade the South because of the Moat?

"&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lcrvm1zbr6c21.jpg

This picture is from one of the promo commercials of the Night King staring down Winterfell from a hilltop. If you Look closely, there are seven black diamonds spiraling into his pupil. I'm asking if this has been seen before; if it could be symbolistic of The Seven or have any relation to the spiral symbol we see throughout the seasons.

To help explain my visual, this is what I see in the picture above... [https://imgur.com/a/OfKRtIS](https://imgur.com/a/OfKRtIS)

My Theory: Could The Seven have been reborn? Could John be the Warrior? Arya the Stranger? Sam/Tyrion the Crone? Gendry the Smith, Jamie the Father, Sansa the Mother, (Though I feel there could be other contenders for mother.) and finally Brienne as the Maiden. 

Again all theory, you all could have completely different people matched up with one of the Seven or you could think the theory is hot garbage, that's okay too. Just interested in what everyone's thoughts are. ",1
"How would you play your hand from here?

My plan would be dragon focused:

1. Stop having sex with brother for a few weeks/months to put together a plan
2. Plan consists of mass producing scorpions to secure the cities and shipping lanes
3. Continuous testing on various bolt designs. Hollowpoints, poison tipped etc
4. Support with modified seige weaponry, also testing experimental ammunition. Does wildfire finish a downed dragon or just make it stronger? Starving brother has to find this out for me if he hopes to ever get any again.

&#x200B;

Here is the key for all this: I'm not looking to actually kill the dragon, but force it into the fringes.

If the dragon has to take huge risks in battle it can not reign free like it did in the Lannister battle. That returns power to manned armies and brings the Lannisters back into a somewhat even matchup.

Scorpions and modified seige weapons do become a target to defend though, adding to the complexity for field commanders.

How would you guys deal with a couple menacing dragons, and everything else, to retain your hold on the throne from the current moment?",1
I was rewatching the series and now I'm at s7 and through the episodes I couldn't help but notice one similarity. In ep 5 in the North we can see Sansa and Arya...(but here's where it gets weird)..they have the same attire as in the teasers.. Even Sansa's hairstyle and dress is the same..Also Aryas attire is the same... I guess this is a twist in the plot...,1
"I don't think this is likely but is it possible that Benjen Stark knew about Jon's true parents? Benjen is very loyal and would do anything for family. Keeping a brother's secret to his own grave would not be unreasonable for his character.

What even made him so close to Jon to begin with? Why not treat him like a bastard? Maybe Benjen just has a good heart or MAYBE Ned shared a secret. It would make sense why Benjen seemed to really want to look out for Jon and to make him into a man.",1

"There is a dialogue between Ned and Arya when they are talking about the fight with Joffrey on the King's Road (Season 1, Episode 3 - 15:46) where Ned says ""Joffrey was dragged before the king and queen, and asked to call the prince a liar"". During that sentence Ned seems to mouth something different, possibly a different line, that looks to be covered with audio of the above line that made the final cut. Anyone good at reading lips that can tell what he is possibly saying?

&#x200B;

The line is 14 minutes and \~3 seconds after the start of the intro.",1

"In S07E04, when Daenerys is attacking the loot train, why did she focus her efforts on burning the grain wagons rather than burning the entire line of Lannister soldiers?

Doesn't her men need food?",1
"Bran will warg into the Night King to aid Jon and the north fight Cersei and her horde of dragonlings that were recently hatched from the dragon eggs that were stored under Kings landing and that were hatched in the Wildfire explosion there. They may even be aided by undead soldiers if Qyburn managed to get the whole necromancering thing figured out.

Why would I think that? 

Some people have said it is interesting that the Season 8 trailer left Bran out. I think they did not, that was Bran as the Night King coming to meet Jon, Sansa and Arya in the crypts. The hint is the freezing raven feather.

Bran clearly had some connection with the Night King when he was touched by the Night King. The Night King twice left Sam alive, Sam and Bran have become friends. Bran was fortold that he would never walk again but he would fly, that is him flying on the resurrected dragon. Bran is also responsible for making King Aerys II Targaryen into the Mad King by breaking his mind like he did to Hodor trying to warg into him for some reason, maybe trying to get him to destroy all the dragon eggs stored in Kings landing. After that fails Bran is left with a last option of warging into the Night King where he will get stuck.

Dany's 3 eggs were not the only dragon eggs in the world, they were rare and precious like big gemstones, but not unheard of. There were dragon skeletons in Kings landing, I am certain there would also be eggs there. Wildfire could hatch the dragon eggs, and no viewer/reader would want to see Cersei with an army of dragons. Cersie would never team up with Jon and Dany to fight anything and Jon's whole army couldn't stand a week against the white walker army. Jon has already teamed up with the Wildlings, his former enemies - that is his MO.  Qyburn was very interested in the undead hand, his ambitions far exceed just the Mountain's resurrection.",1
"I'm rewatching GoT and have been reminded of something. In the earlier seasons, you didn't really know who to root for. Rob Stark attacks the Lanisrers, well I like both Rob and Tyrion so I don't really know which side I want to win. Stanis vs Kings landing: I was on Stanis's side, but still didn't want Tyrion to die. I liked Stannis, but got goosebumps when Breanne executed him.
I could go on, but my point is that this system made conflicts much more engaging and it has changed.

Now it's Denerys (not looking up spelling) and Jon vs the white walkers and Cersie (still not looking it up). It just doesn't feel the same. Everything is so clear cut. Good vs evil. It just doesn't have the same gravity as before. It feels to by the numbers. Am I the only one that feels this way?",1
"Since he was risen from the dead, is he alive or dead but functioning like Benjen was?",1
"This may sound like a strange one. No, I am not some kind of pervert – basically my parents want to watch the show, which is great, however I would like to rewatch it with them but am really not looking forward to sitting through all the sex and nudity in their presence. That would be extremely awkward.

So in order to forewarn myself of these scenes, I was wondering if anyone could somehow supply me with a list of all the sex/nudity scenes in the show, including:

- the season and episode
- the time stamp
- what's going on in the scene (some nudity I might be able to sit through, but Cersei and Jaime going at it? Nah)

I know it might be a big ask, but thanks to anyone who can help!

If this is not possible, it would be great to hear from people who have watched the show with their parents. How awkward did you find it?

Edit: Some people are getting the wrong idea. I'm not going to skip these scenes, I'm going to make myself scarce. Y'know, make a cup of tea or go to the bathroom.

Edit 2: Yeah I thought every scene might be a long shot. Even just the more graphic sex scenes would help.",1
"Sorry for the obscure and vague title, i didn't wanna spoil anything, I'm not super active here so i wasn;t sure how I should phrase the title.

Anyhoo, in this clip GRRM mentions that Dany (or Emilia Clark anyway) is on location in Spain. Check it out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X_0PSvGhvc

Does this mean that Dany goes to Dorne? The video itself is new, but the interview might be older so it is possible that he's reffering to a previous season's shooting, especially since shooting on eight is almost certainly wrapped. But Slaver's bay was shot in Morocco (also discussed in the video), whereas we know that Dorne was filmed in Spain.

The only logical conclusion i can make is that Dany goes to Dorne in season eight. Whyfore? Maybe to resurrect her alliance with the Dornishmen?

"Too many fan theories have already made all of us to believe that Night King could be a Stark or Brandon Stark himself. Additionally few more die hard fans are now rooting for White Walkers and the one true and (possibly) undefeated leader in the world of ASOIAF aka Night King. What i believe is very simple and it can actually unravel the myths about Night King and why White walkers are back after 8000 years after they were defeated in the Long Night.

&#x200B;

Before i start let me help you recall few things happened in the TV series. Samwell Tarly wasn't killed by White Walkers. The White Walker showed him mercy, second time at the Hardhome Night King was looking into the eyes of John Snow, obviously he was looking with optimism(so many theories are already there about it but none is convincing enough). Third at John Snow's suicide mission Night King can easily kill a dragon but he did nothing against the John's men. He could've easily killed each one of them with his spears. But that's not them they don't kill people on purpose. They didn't hurt Sam because he was innocent and pure heart person just like the Night King himself. Second, John is the key to everything and Night King knows about it that he is his only hope. I will break it later.

&#x200B;

Lets come to the main part of the theory, i believe Night King is too powerful to lose and no\_one can defeat him. He hasn't come to conquer but he has come to offer solution and real peace in the Realm. He was wandering in far North with his White Walkers and protecting the realm of man from themselves, because we know he was made to kill mankind by children of forest but he is man himself and part of him never wants to kill another human. The man who was turned into first White walker by Children of Forest was actually betrayed by Children and turned into deadly evil.  He was there to offer peace at the first place and his heart was pure and the purity is still living in him that is why he wasn't killing people in all these years. The magic is back to seven kingdoms since we start watching the  things on HBO premium. The dragons are back, Warlocks, White Walkers, Dire Wolfs(which are magical creatures too and far more important than dragons and too many things have are happening once again. Night King knows it is the time and that is why they are back. They want to get rid of their miserable life and wants to come back to real life. They are the only protector of realm, and they can do so by killing themselves and killing all the magic with them, so one race can't have superiority on another in ASOIF worlds, Targaryen used dragon(magical creature) to rule over the other races and control the resources and law. Just like Thanos, Night King also wants balance and it can only be achieved if magic can be ended. so far we have seen the destruction caused by the magic, souls were burn alive by Red Priestess, genitals of man/children were used for magical spells, faceless man are using black magic from centuries and don't forget first White Walker was created by magic itself. So, if White Walkers die all the magic will die with them, resulting in the balance in the realm(who is the protector of realm now). Its the Night King.

&#x200B;

Coming to the point why White walkers are back now and what is possibly going to happen next. Everyone knows John and Night King has a special connection and so does the Bran and the Night King. So, here is the catch John is way more magical creature than anyone else in the ASOIF, he had defeated one God already.....God of Death and he is way too lucky(it is magic again) than any other character in Game of Thrones. He is a special Child possessing the magical powers of  Starks and Targaryens.  Night King knows everything about him (as he is Greenseer and more powerful than Three Eyed Raven) and John with the help of Bran can defeat him and put an end to his miserable life. Don't forget he still feels like human and he is in great pain, which is his real power. His weakness is his power. But the only problem with hm is the Dragon Glass, which i think is behind the birth of Dragons also, he can't overpower the magical abilities of the dragon glass and he is controlled by it. He has to get rid of dragon glass and i don't know how but John with help of Bran will help him getting rid of dragon glass. So, he is back because John is born and Bran is there to help his brother. The Night King himself wanted to be defeated for the survival of mankind.",1
"Anyone think there will be any repercussions for Theon taking Winterfell from Bran.  When he knew Bran was helpless and alone in season 2?  I mean at this point, its a moot point, and probably wont mean much in the final season and everything they need to sort out.  I know Theon has been through a lot since season 2, but I could see Arya avenging Bran.  ",1
"What are some tactics that Jon could have actually used, that would have greatly reduced the Stark casualties in the Battle of the Bastards?",1
"In the first episode Ned says, ""The man who passes the sentence must swing the sword"". Robb also mentions it when he kills Rikard Karstark. John also lives up to this and swings the sword in his executions as Lord Commander. I think the only example of a Stark not following this is Arya killing littlefinger after Sansa passes the sentence. In fact, Illyn Payne killing Ned may be the only other example of the sentencer not being the executioner, though I may be wrong. What is the reason for this? Girls having never been taught this by Ned? Sansa learning from Geoffrey in Kings Landing? Something else?",1
"During a life or death fight I'm sure it's everything. But as a matter of rank, profession, wealth, how much does it matter?

Jaime didn't seem to lose much after losing his hand.

He, Selmy and Dayne were Kingsguards. I'm not sure how powerful that role is alone but it seems like a 6/10 at best (You know what Tywin says about it).

King Robert would be a good mention for the other side of the argument. In his case I wonder if he could have just rented a few more unsullied or golden company to do even better from afar.

Is swordsmanship really powerful, perhaps a fast lane to the traditional powers in this world? Or is it more of a stick measuring contest?",1
"I understand if you like her when appealing to things like savagery or edginess, but I keep seeing far too often all these fanatics all over the internet or in real life who actually empathize with her and and think she's actually a sympathetic person, like ""Oh poor Cersei, she is so misunderstood, got cheated on by Robert, been neglected by Jamie, and she does nothing but love her children. It's not fair everything what happened to her!"" I mean, are you kidding me? Everything she has done she has brought on herself with her own selfishness, narcissism, hatred, and arrogance. She becomes even more psychopathic later on in the series. I'd go so far as to rank her right behind Joffrey and Ramsay in terms of evil.

&#x200B;

Again, it's understandable if you like her because you think she's cool or edgy, but to think she's this sympathetic poor misunderstood character with great moral potential is just irrational.",1
"One of the biggest elephants in the room at Castle Black in early seasons is that the wall is desperately undermanned.  Once it became clear that the dead were rising (this was generally accepted as shown by the practice of burning bodies being routine), and that White Walkers were returning, there is an obvious solution:  instead of the Battle of Castle Black, couldn't someone have offered Mance Rayder's group the possibility of occupying the abandoned castles in exchange for pledging their support to defending the wall?  Probably would have had to have someone else besides the Thenn evacuate the northernmost villages, but that would have been far less bloody than what happened, and in the end the defenses would be at full strength again.  Mance wouldn't even have to bend the knee to any King, lose any men fighting the formidable Castle Black even if victory was assured, and even if they formally were commanded by Castle Black, by strength of army he would be the strongest power at the wall.  Strong incentive for him to accept.

I think I have to blame Lord Commander Mormont.  He was right to bring a force north of the wall--but instead of having Jon kill him and engage in espionage, he should have let them be taken and made such an offer directly to Mance.   A similar idea comes up later, but it seems like it should have been made much sooner, and while Mance was still alive to provide unity.

Maybe Jon would have thought of it while negotiating with Mance, if Stannis hadn't arrived just then.",1
"My thoughts are the Mountain, Red Viper and Sir Barriston Selmy! ",1
"Bran(The Three Eyed Raven) is going to tell Jon who is real parents are and could possibly see ways to defeat the white walkers how man did way back when. Maybe could see how they built the wall. I'd say their only way to win the great war is with ""wild fire"", because after all Jon and Daenerys are Targaryens. I don't see any other way they could possibly win. This makes sense also because ""Brandon The Builder"" who originally built the wall was also the founder of House Stark.

"I don't understand why everybody complains about how quickly travel happens in later seasons. Now, I understand the show and the books were built off of the traveling, sense of urgency, and how time was of the essence, but the idea that the show has never taken liberties with traveling is absurd. In Season 1 Episode 2 Catelyn Stark is in the Godswood of Winterfell discussing the Lannister plot. In the very NEXT episode she's in King's Landing. Even if it's more apparent now, it was always there.

TLDR: The show's been taking liberties with travel time since Season 1",1
"...destroyed Ned Stark's Valyrian greatsword, Ice, so that he could forge two smaller Valyrian swords. Valyrian swords are rare (~200 in the 7 kingdoms, according to the books) and I'm sure their value doesn't scale linearly with size. If a 50cm Valyrian sword was worth X, a 1m Valyrian sword would be worth more than 2X.

Ice was probably one of the largest remaining Valyrian swords, so Tywin breaking it down to get two average swords seems like a terrible business decision. It doesn't seem to fit Tywin's character either, seeing as he's supposed to be an economical man. Ice was probably exponentially more valuable than the sum of the two new swords.

It's a shame, kind of always bothered me that Ned's sword was reforged.",1
"I'm rewatching Season 1 currently, and I was reminded of the exact moment I began to hate Cersei. I really hope that Arya gets to kill Cersei, because she made Ned kill Lady.

"This was probably already posted here at some time but here goes. A lot of people have subscribed to the theory that Bran put the thought ""Burn them all"" in the Mad King's head but what if it was Bran as The Night King who put that thought in his head so that the initial events of killing Brandon and Rickard Stark would serve as the catalyst for Robert's Rebellion, the downfall of House Targaryen, the surge in power for House Lannister and so forth until The Night King gets a dragon to burn down the wall and invade Westeros for a yet undetermined endgame?",1

"Lots of theories floating around about Azor Ahai, the night king, 13th lord commander of the nights watch, Nissa Nissa, etc.

My prediction is that we get an ENTIRE episode, or close to it,that goes back in time and explains and shows this whole history.  Maybe as a Bran flashback.

2. Did Tyrion ever speak / meet with Edward Stark at all, not sure in books or tv show, would have been great.

How badass would be if the night king won right? I think it'd be metal as fuck. But what if he wins gets to the iron throne sits down and just shatters.

"FYI I haven't fully read the books yet so this is more in reference to the show.

What is it? Where did it come from? Why does it only transmit thru direct contact of the skin? Why does it make you savage and why send them to the destroyed city of Valyria?

Did the NK create it after failing to destroy Valyria and what it held(valyian steel, dragons)? I might have my timelines mixed up but if I'm right then last time the long night came was roughly the same time that (supposedly) the greatest city in history fell. What's your thoughts? Will this disease have any significance to the main story? Will it be addressed in the Age of Heroes spin off?

Edit: A couple have commented in regards to me being off with the destruction of valyria. I'd like to point out I'm more interested in the show and greyscale atm since I haven't read all the books yet. Also since it is in the books doesn't mean the show will follow the same line. Even the director of the show has stated that the show is different from the books so basing the show of the books isn't accurate. Valyria was destroyed by a volcano as someone pointed out in the books but there is no proof of what destroyed it in the show. It more or less looks like the city just collapsed rather than being melted and buried under ash and lava. Ex. Look at Pompeii, whole city buried by the ash and lava. Wouldn't the same thing happen to valyria to some extent rather than the city just looking post apocalypse? ",1
"What if The Seven (Gods) are the ones who are deep in the crypts of Winterfell? What if The Maiden is the Night's Queen? The current NK knows they're down there. They say dragons bring back magic. Maybe NK knows he needs a dragon at Winterfell to wake up the previous kings in the crypts. They say iron rusts so the iron swords guarding the statues/sarcophagi are gone. All that's needed to awaken the dead is magic. They always say magic disappeared when dragons died out, so perhaps dragons bring back the magic. Maybe the NK NEEDS the dragons to be at Winterfell and he knows they (dragons) will be there bc he saw Jon and Dany riding one- which is why he let them go. He didn't take the dragon she was riding bc he knew they would go back to WF and dragon magic is needed to wake The Seven.

Also wanted to add: MAYBE the NK \*has\* to go to WF bc there are no Starks at WF. It's part of the pact. He (NK) is a Stark- so he's keeping the pact himself now. Sansa is a LANNISTER/BOLTON, Arya is a FACELESS MAN, Jon is a TARG, and Bran is the 3-eyed Raven. There are technically no Starks at WF at the moment. Not too confident about this last part since NK has been on the move since first episode- but I feel like the fact there are no Starks at WF has a lot to do, or will have a lot to do with what's currently happening. Perhaps NK can also tap into the Weirwood net and he knew the pact was broken the minute there were no Starks at Winterfell.

The others were much more powerful then man and could easily replenish its Army.

For large scale battle scene, I'm going with the battle at Castle Black and the wall because there was so much variety to it.  There were giants and woolly mammoths working to open the gate on the wall, wildlings climbing up the ice wall, Tormund, Ygritte and the Therns doing battle inside of Castle Black, etc.  For my runner-up on large battle scene, it's close between Jon and the wildlings fighting the Night King, WW's, wights or Jon and the wildlings vs. Ramsay Bolton.  I'll probably give the edge to Jon and the wildlings vs. Ramsay Bolton because there was more strategy involved (or less strategy in Jon's case) and Sansa coming to Jon's rescue was interesting.

"There's something I've noticed about her character in Season 7 upon rewatching it. At the beginning she's got a huge ego, sense of entitlement, and a quick temper. We see this pretty much all throughout some previous seasons and most of Season 7. However once she sees the Army of the Dead and Viserion is killed, her world gets turned upside down. In the span of a few minutes not only does she see that the boogeyman is real, he also just killed one of her invincible dragons, and what she feels is one of her children for that matter. This is all capped off later that day when during her silent grieving, not only does she see the man she's growing in love with return alive, she also finally realizes that Davos was being literal when he said Jon died for his people. Despite seeing the absolute worst of men all the time during her journey, she finally sees one who rose to power because he truly loves his people, and inspires them to be the best they can. 

From that point forward, she doesn't show any of the personality traits I mentioned above. Seeing her almost cry by Jon's bedside, it was like seeing the old Dany again back in S1 and S2. When Jon pledged his loyalty to her, her response wasn't ""Thank you"" or ""About time"". It was ""I hope I deserve it."" From there and Episode 7, she comes off more humble than she used to be.

I hope they continue this new development of her character into Season 8. I love Jon Snow, but just like Dany he isn't perfect. But I believe these two compliment each other so well, because they both make up for each other's flaws. While Jon can inspire Daenerys to reign her temper and ego in, and be more compassionate, Dany can make the tough decisions that Jon can't bring himself to. Not to mention get him out of trouble that his honor gets himself into.

"So watching some episodes of Game of Thrones again, I had some questions about the faceless assassins.

The part when Arya and Jaqen talk he appears to be giving the poison to Arya but drinks it and dies. The Waif removes her face to reveal Jaqen's face.

Arya then proceeds to remove the face of Jaqen from the dead body, then reveals her own face.

So I've read the books also, my questions are: Can the faceless assassins wear the face of a living person without killing them, some form of glamor maybe?

Multiple copies of the same face, Waif Jaqen and the Jaqen face on the dead body?

I get the impression that Jaqen has been dead already and the faceless assassins wear that face throughout so we as a audience have a reference.

But is the Waif already dead like Jaqen and the face is just being used by different faceless people?

Also when Arya killed the Waif and took the face to hang on the wall, was that the the original face of the assassin, or if a faceless person wore the Waif face, would they go after Arya again?",1

Just like Renly, there was more than meets the eyeWe know that Barristan Selmy was badly hurt at the Battle of the Trident but he was pardoned by Robert, and held in **high praise** by both him and **Ned Stark**. For fighting against them?

> Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident.

Rhaegar died with **Lyanna** Stark's name **on his lips**. 

According to a semi-canon source, Rhaegar's body was **cremated**, as is traditional for fallen Targaryens...Only **death** can pay for **life**.  But then how do we actually know it was Rhaegar who died there?

We hear of another defeat, at the hand of [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) himself, where he defeated Robert at the Battle of Ashford. 

Although, it was largely won by Randyll Tarly by the time he got there. Still, Mace Tyrell "" is considered an oaf by his mother, and by Cersei Lannister, and a **fool** by Prince Oberyn Martell. Out of his three sons, he considers Loras to be his favourite.But he really didn't care for Willas, whom he sent to fight in a tourney at 10 to fight the Viper, unless the boy saw something he should not have...


>  [[Willas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI)](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willas_Tyrell\)) was born the eldest son to Lord **Mace Tyrell**(*the fool?*) and Lady Alerie **Hightower**. During his **first tourney**, he competed **against Prince Oberyn Martell** of Dorne, who **knocked Willas** from his horse. Unfortunately, his foot caught in his stirrup as he fell, and [Willas pulled his horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcnFPp2mFoc) on top of him, [crushing his leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgsbTSVLD4) and leaving him **a cripple**.



Robert was not a great warrior. He couldn't have defeated Jon Connington before and he wouldn't have been able to defeat Rhaegar on the battlefield. Just like Mace Tyrell, and like his brother later on,  **Robert Baratheon**, had a warrior to fight in his stead. 

The rubies in the ford that were scattered in the river were not from Rhaegar's breastplate.. They were from Jon's.

> Robert is a man of huge appetites, who knows how to take his pleasures. He is quite promiscuous, and has fathered multiple bastard children. His lusts are the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realms.


Robert, after winning the Throne, accepts red priests(who turn him more into even more a drunkard rather than save him) at his court. Why he chooses to marry Cersei Lannister.. and to pardon Barristan Selmy, who after killing Jon Connington, would have done the same to Robert.

According to Archmaester Gyldayn, Alyn's origins remain a matter of dispute among historians to this day. **His mother**, Marilda of Hull, **claimed** he and his brother Addam were **fathered by Ser Laenor Velaryon** -- a fact that many found remarkable due to** Laenor's known sexual preference for men.** The court **fool** Mushroom **claimed** they were fathered by Laenor's father, Lord **Corlys Velaryon**,but **kept unacknowledged** and far from court in order to not offend Corlys's fiery-tempered wife, Rhaenys Targaryen.

Two brothers had been born as Lords of the Tides and heirs to Driftmark. One of them, Addam, would manage to win Lord Velaryon's old dragon, Seasmoke. His brother, who initially went after the wildest dragon, **Grey Ghost**, would almost get killed by Sheepstealer. Alyn was then said to have had two bastards children by **Elaena Targaryen**. He would name them **Jon** and **Jeyne Waters**.... A distant relative of Elaena, Brown Ben Plumm, the commander of the Second Sons, would end up miraculosly fighting for Daenerys..

It was said that  Ser **Barristan**, together with Arthur Dayne, also defeated [The Smiling Knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight), another **mistery** warrior.

Another person Barristan kills is [**Symon Hollard**](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Symon_Hollard), the uncle to **the fool** Dontos, who ""kidnapped"" the Mad King  so [Barristan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZGLUKIt9w) can [save him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QoqYXuA8LI) and avenge [ Gwayne Gaunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpVCPvgCD7c) . He was said to have also killed ***Maelys I Blackfyre*** , the last of the **Blackfyre pretender**s, called Monstrous for supposedly having **eaten his twin in the womb**,  making him a  **kinslayer**.

As regards to the [Doom of Old Valyria](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria), the [faceless men](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men) had a hand in it, for sure.

Why  **was Gregor Clegane was fighting with skinny prisoners**  who could barely hold a sword? Probably because they were **offerings to the Red God**. The **Lannister** colours are a golden **lion on a **crimson** field**.........

When The Red Keep had started **worshipping other Gods**, the **wildfire** under the Red Keep, **the light**, R'hllor's favourite weapon, was finally put to use. All **trapped** in one place. All **offerings to the God of Fire and Death**.

Red Priests whisper life back into people. Well who is Varys if not the Master of Whisperers? Then who must his replacement be?

Although **Daenerys** ""freed"" the people, she was still a **ruler** who would pride herself in her **old Valiryan blood**, and  who would [cheat a merchant man of his price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpwtoHv8E6k), as if her cause excuses the deed. Her **Unsullied**, though she forgets,  are quite the cruel warriors. In order to become Unsullied, they **must kill a baby**. Could this be an **offering to R'hllor**? We also know that their **manhoods** are **cut off**..


> ""The little scribe with the **big golden eyes** was **wise beyond her years.** She is **brave as well**. She had to be, to survive the life she's lived... **She relied so much on the little scribe** that she oft forgot that Missandei had only turned eleven.""(Daenerys, thinking about Missandei). 

[Missandei and Grey Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9icZ9sfyvk) had been with **Daenerys** since she **took** over **the Unsullied** [by force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXpHvhjUzAI). 
>  When Daenerys disappears on Drogon's back, **Hizdahr zo Loraq** attempts to **order** **the Unsullied** but **Grey Worm** and his men** refuse to obey him**. However when **Ser Barristan Selmy** goes to Grey Worm for his help in **seizing control** of Meereen, Grey Worm agrees to aid Selmy**. Grey Worm becomes a member of the ruling council of Meereen**. (A dance with Dragons)

**Missandrei** had never taken off her slave ring from around her neck. Her clothes look very simmilar to the actual **merchant** who wants to sell her **Daenerys** the **Unsullied she can't afford**..   **Like Mirri Maz Duur**, Missandei **could not be freed by Daenerys** because did not need her freedom[ to begin with](https://youtu.be/pJP9o6QMk-E?t=18).(""For now.."")



 You can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hRo54XNvek) how Davos, a well traveled man, reacts when he asks about Missandei's accent.

> ""‘**Grey Worm**’ gives this one **pride**. It is a **lucky** name. The name this one was born with was **cursed**. That was the name he had when he was taken as a **slave**. But **Grey Worm** is the name **this one** had **the day Daenerys** Stormborn **set him free**"" 

Something tells me the leader of the Unsullied did not need her freedom..

> **The great goddess of the Unsullied** is called by many names, including the **Lady of Spears**, the Bride of Battle, and the **Mother of Hosts**. According to Grey Worm, her **true name** belongs only to the ones who have **burned their manhoods** upon her **altar**. The Unsullied **purify** themselves according to the laws of their **great goddess**; one way is to **bathe in the salt sea**. The Unsullied may **not speak of the great goddess** to others. 

Another ""actor"" around Daenerys who actually changes faces with our knowledge is Daario Naharis.. We are led to believe the change of actors was done on purpose when in fact, what a clever way to hide a faceless man who tries to court Danny, initially looking like what people might imagine a younger Rhaegar but seeing that doesn't work out, just have him be a younger and bolder Jorah kind of guy.

We know that **Jorah** Mormont, **the bear**, got exiled for selling slaves. right around Robert's Rebellion and he fled to the Free Cities to **avoid being executed by Eddard Stark**. Jorah, despite his house being on Bear Island, had been living on Essos at the time.. Now, why would Eddard Stark from Westeros want to execute Jorah, after he had already been stripped of his titles?

 Coincidentally, that is also the place where ""Jon Connington"" went  to drink himself to death after he had lost his title as Hand of the King during the ""sword"" fighting he had with Robert...

Years later, Jorah, son of Jeor(sworn to the Night's Watch as a celibate), finds himself in the company of his **silver queen**. The story of the maiden fair who must realize who the bear next to her is..
