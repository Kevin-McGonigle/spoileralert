"A multitude of religions are followed by different cultures and peoples throughout the Known World. These can range from widespread belief systems followed by great numbers of people, to more localized faiths followed only by a select group.

"Individual religious devotion in all societies is, of course, on a spectrum, from devout adherents to those that just go through some of the motions by rote as a cultural norm. Some people are also irreligious and privately don't believe in any gods or religious systems.

"In contrast to Westeros, the eastern continent of Essos (across the Narrow Sea) is home to a large number of religions. Unlike the Faith of the Seven, however, few of these religions are widespread across large geographical areas: The Free City of Braavos does have a very diverse, cosmopolitan religious makeup, but each of the Free Cities, as well as the cities of Slaver's Bay, may contain worshipers of numerous local religions not found anywhere else in the world. The one major exception is the faith of the Lord of Light, which is very widespread, from the Free Cities in the west to Asshai in the distant east. Indeed, in the southern Free Cities such as Volantis, Lys, and Myr, the Lord of Light is the majority religion, and it has at least a plurality in many other major cities across the continent. Still, unlike in Westeros where the Faith of the Seven is often the exclusive religion, in many cities in Essos where the Lord of Light is the majority religion, there are still substantial minorities that follow other religions.

"A number of lesser cults are spread throughout the Free Cities and the rest of Essos, which worship other deities such as:

"George R.R. Martin explained his views on religion in the storyverse of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels: there is no one ""true"" religion, and as in real life, it is unconfirmed if any of the deities in these religions really exist. This is closely tied to depictions of magic in the storyverse: In Martin's view, something qualifies as ""magic"" when it is a mysterious and not fully understood force: if it was fully understood and could be reliably/consistently practiced - like spells cast in a Dungeons & Dragons game - it would really just be ""technology"" called by another name. Magic is indeed real in Martin's world, but in recent millennia, few people have experienced it or still believe in it, and none can truly be said to totally understand it. Some groups interpret these magical forces through the framework of the religious beliefs they have constructed, but it is unclear if they are correct.

"For example, Melisandre is a follower of the Lord of Light, and she wields some magical powers - namely prophecies viewed through flames (though she doesn't always interpret them correctly) - and her fellow Red Priest Thoros of Myr was even able to resurrect the dead. This does not, however, prove with certainty that the Lord of Light Melisandre believes in actually exists - not as she chooses to understand Him, at least. For all she really knows, it is the Stranger aspect of the Seven that is answering her prayers, or the Drowned God, or some other completely unknown force that no religion has ever accurately described. She and other magic users are dabbling in forces beyond human comprehension, and religions like the Lord of Light are a mental framework developed to attempt to explain them. It is possible that whatever ""magical"" forces exist in the world might not even be accurately described as ""religious"" in nature, save that people apply these meanings to them. Or that the Seven-faced God worshiped in Westeros might literally exist as an actual deity - the point is that really knows for sure.

"There is actually a fourth religion present말n Westeros;맚he worship of Mother Rhoyne, but its numbers are very small, and its practice is restricted맚o minority group in easternDorne. A thousand years ago, the Rhoynar people fled Valyria's western expansion and eventually settled inDorne, where they intermingled with the local populations ofㅁndals and First Men to form their own unique culture. Most of the Rhoynar마bandoned their old religion and adopted the Faith of the Seven, but a small handful clung to their previousriver-based culture and religion. Living on boats moving up and down the Greenblood River in Dorne, this small minority became known as the ""Orphans of the Greenblood"", ""orphans"" because they were맙eparated from their homeland in Essos. Originally, the Rhoynar lived in맊ity-states located on the great Rhoyne River and its network of tributaries, in the area of the modern Free Cities. The spirit of the Rhoyne River itself is worshiped in the religion as ""Mother Rhoyne"", though there are several other river-themed deities in the religion, such as the Old Man of the River, a turtle-god, and his enemy the King Crab.

"There are a few other religions or cults that get namedropped as existing in the Free Cities, but맚hey aren't followed말n large numbers and don't play a major role in맚he storyline. Many are mentioned only once, and are often inside jokes by author George R.R. Martin, or references to other science fiction stories he has written. While the Lord of Light말s the majority religion in the southern Free Cities of Volantis, Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh, other religions are practiced alongside it: A handful of artistocratic families in Volantis still follow the old Valyrian religion (though they are a minority); coins in Lys are adroned with the image of a native love goddess, which may or may not be the same figure as the Weeping Lady;마nd in Tyrosh,맚he Fountain of the Drunken God is dedicated to the eponymous deity, and the Temple of Trios honors the three-headed god of the same name.

"The Lord of Light doesn't seem to be the majority religion in the northern Free Cities, though their exact beliefs have not been given in detail. The Lord of Light is worshiped in Pentos and Qohor and even has a notable맗resence in Braavos, but the exact extent of the religion in these places is uncertain. In Braavos especially, many religions are particed, because of the city's magpie origins. Even the Faith of the Seven has a temple - known as the Sept-Beyond-the-Sea - with its own community of septons and septas, to service merchants and travellers from the Seven Kingdoms.

"Little is known of Sothoryos, or the religious practices of its peoples. The inhabitants of the Summer Isles consider sexuality to be a holy and life-affirming act. The people of the island of Naath, off the north coast of Sothoryos, worship a monotheistic deity known as the Lord of Harmony. The Lord of Harmony religion forbids harming any living thing, even animals, thus the Naathi people are vegetarians, refusing to eat the flesh of any animal, and are famous for their adherence to pacifism.
