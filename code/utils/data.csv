"**Preface: This post will assume Stannis is somehow out of commission; Jon/Sansa are in the North, and Aegon takes the South from the Lannisters/Tyrells; So Dany invades Westeros with the North preparing to fight the Others, and Aegon on the Iron Throne similar-ish to the show with Aegon in a Cersei-ish role**

The above is one of the plausible theories about how the story is going to go. It creates dramatic tension for Dany as she invades with Dothraki rapists and foreign Eunuchs finding that someone else named Targaryen with a better claim already won, The North/Vale (probably) is interested in her help but perhaps not her rule (and she'll later find out her nephew who also has a better claim is up there), and the South is finally enjoying peace under a King that's broadly respected and backed by the GC, Dornish, and Friends in the Reach. 

Posit secondly that the book goes the same way as the show, Aegon (in the role of Cersei) refuses to bring his armies north, and Dany/Jon unite to fight the Others and they win the War for the Dawn. What then? 

**My question is, could it be possible that Dany simply accepts there's no point in her taking the Iron Throne from a Targaryen who she believes, but cannot prove is a fraud?** That she would be the Queen of the Ashes? And for what? Her house is restored, she could send her Dothraki across the sea, maybe keep the Unsullied to defend King's Landing. But the only difference would be Daenerys Targaryen instead of Aegon Targaryen, and tens of thousands would die for it. 

Jon I think would be an even easier sell. He doesn't want to be Aegon Targaryen(see footnote 1), he wants to be Jon Stark. I think he'll choose not to reveal his name and his right (if the other Aegon is a fraud then he has the right over Dany) and live the rest of his life in Winterfell at the high table where he always belonged.

This is very different situation in the show, where Cersei embodies so much of the awful suffering of the Targaryens/Starks at the hands of the Lannisters and can/should be destroyed. Aegon's just a different man. 

**Why I think GRRM could plausibly choose this and relatedly why it's narratively satisfying:**: Sometimes you're just not the winner of the story. Jon and Dany could save Westeros but it doesn't make it worthwhile for them to take their surviving forces and try to go destroy tens of thousands more to have one Targaryen over another. Aegon being possibly fake subverts the notion that bloodline actually matters. As far as we can see, Aegon would be a pretty decent King, and certainly no worse than Dany. Having the two main characters give up fighting for the throne after winning the War for the Dawn would make a stronger statement about the horrors of war and what it means to be a true leader than anything else. 

I would be extremely happy with such an ending. (**Caveat: GRRM has said there will be another dance of dragons, so this wouldn't happen, but I just wanted to throw it out there for discussion**)

[Footnote 1: Not important, but yes I believe he was given the same name by Lyanna as a way of honoring the dead child Aegon, Alexander Hamilton did it with a newborn son Phillip after the first Phillip was killed at Weehawken by George Eacker]",SPOILER
"I noticed that in the 14 years he ruled, they never mention him ever getting cut sitting on the Iron Throne. I find that surprising since lesser kings have been cut sitting on it.

I was thinking that maybe it just all has to do with posture and mindset. Sitting on a chair made of literal swords does take a certain finesse. I think it was made that way because as King, one must not overreact to any news that is brought to court. We see examples of what happens when Kings act out of character. Maegor was cruel and violent and full of rage and the throne impaled him. Joffrey shrieked for a man to be executed and the throne sliced his hand. Even Aegon had a momentary lapse of weakness while on the throne when he clenched his hands upon it while reading Princess Deria's letter. I thought it was interesting how Martin can provide a physical representation of how to properly conduct yourself whilst seated on the throne.

Which leads me to my main question, how did Bobby B not get sliced and diced when he was sitting on it? The man became a drunk during his rule and let his small council and Hand run the Kingdom. Moreover, he was a usurper. There had to have been times where he sat on the Throne and presided over something. Unless I'm overlooking a sentence or chapter, how is there no mention of him getting cut? ",SPOILER

We know there was the Valaryan steel dagger, that Littlefinger claims belongs to Tyrion. Later on, Tyrion contemplates the whole theory and comes to the conclusion, that it was Joffrey, who did it to impress Robert Baratheon, since he heard him saying ""It's better to die than to live a cripple"".

"    While both families are known for their dynastic feud, they have intermarried just as frequently as they have quarrelled in an attempt to bind their houses.
    While the Blackwoods emphasize their First Men heritage and still follow the Old Gods, the Bracken's also descend from the First Men. More so, all Brackens have Blackwood blood and all Blackwoods have Bracken blood, yet only House Blackwood has a history of magically inclined progeny, and association with weirwoods and ravens. 
    Among other notable First Men magic, skinchanging is noted as being lesser than a warg in power, while a warg (skinchanging a wolf [or dire wolf??]) is less powerful than a greenseer (weirwood.net). Skinchangers are known to form close bonds with animals easily, including near telepathic relationships.
    House Bracken is, however, notable for their cavalry and horse rearing. I believe that House Bracken's affinity for horses is derived from their First Men blood, specifically latent skinchanging magic. Worshipping the Old Gods would provide a cultural motivation to understand strange visions and symptoms for developing Blackwood skinchangers and greenseers, but any Brackens with First Men magic would be unlikely to acknowledge the magic's legitimacy due to their belief in The Seven and therefore the power would be left untapped and exist only in the medium of martial animal husbandry. All septons and depths would condemn visions or animal dreams as children's nonsense, associating any '""horse dreams""ù with learned martial affinity, and ironically probably recommending riding horses more due to the child's apparent interest.
    I can't help but think that GRRM intended for us to see the contrast between a focus on the Old Gods and cultural dilution by the Andals. The only true difference between the Brackens and the Blackwoods is the identity they give themselves.

Tl;dr - Brackens unwittingly use latent skinchanging magic to bond with horses.

"I'm sorry if this has been brought up before, but I searched for this and couldn't find anything alluding to this bit of foreshadowing so I figured I'd make a stab at it.

In Dany II, Daenerys is being bathed by Irri, Jhiqui, and Doreah after the confrontation with Viserys in the Dothraki Sea. She asks them if they have seen any dragons, but they respond in the negative.

> ""Have you ever seen a dragon?"" she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and Jhiqui sluiced sand from her hair. She had heard that the first dragons had come from the east, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea. Perhaps some were still living there, in realms strange and wild. ""Dragons are gone, *Khaleesi*,"" Irri said. ""Dead,"" agreed Jhiqui. ""Long and long ago.""

Soon after, Doreah chimes in with the origin story of dragons that she heard from a trader from Qarth.

> ""He told me the moon was an egg, *Khaleesi*,"" the Lysene girl said. ""Once there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.""

The moon and sun imagery struck me as, having read the series before, I remember the names Drogo and Daenerys call each other: ""Moon of My Life"" and ""My Sun and Stars"". Dany, being the moon, wandered too close to the sun, Drogo, and it cracked her: she took part in blood magic that resulted into the death of her son and the fall into a vegetative state of Drogo. She then took her three dragon eggs into Drogo's funeral pyre, allowing her dragons to drink the ""fire of the sun"" and be born again, resulting in dragons returning to the world. 

Just thought it was an awesome bit of foreshadowing, and wanted to showcase Martin's talent in case this hasn't been discussed before. I'm looking forward to noticing many more moments like this in the future.

"The theory about Aegon being a Blackfyre descendant has been discussed numerous times. I think most of you know the popular arguments for it: [*the clanking dragon story*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/3gfxqi/spoilers_affc_the_clanking_dragon/)*, Checkov's female line of Blackfyres, Illryio's love for the boy and his late valyrian looking wife, the support of the golden company, etc.*

But there is another potential hint that i haven't seen being brought up enough. **The character of Miles Toyne.**

To remind you, he was a captain-general of the Golden Company before Harry Strickland. It was him who, along with Illyrio and Connington, plotted to put Aegon on the Iron Throne. It was him who agreed to provide the Golden Company's services for him:

>Homeless Harry Strickland paused with his blistered foot in hand. ""Let me remind you, it was Myles Toyne who put his seal to this secret pact, not me.

However, he died few years prior to the events of ADWD.

So how does Myles point to Aegon being a Blackfyre? Well, the most obvious thing is his nickname. **Blackheart.** In-universe, it's a reference  to the sigil of House Toyne. But on the meta level, it may be a hint from George.

Perhaps this is why the Golden Company broke their contract for the first time in history. Because their captain's heart is black.

But there is more. In the past, i often argued that Aegon being a Blackfyre (or at least not being Rhaegar's son) should be true because of how it fits into JonCon's story, among other reasons. It adds a great layer of tragedy to his character.

A man driven by guilt and grief tries to redeem himself. He wants to correct his mistakes, to silence the sound of bells in his head, to do right by Rhaegar.

>I wanted the glory of slaying Robert in single combat, and I did not want the name of butcher. So Robert escaped me and cut down Rhaegar on the Trident. ""I failed the father,"" he said, ""but I will not fail the son.""

And in his desperate quest for redemption, [he will indeed become a butcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4cql8x/spoilers_everything_the_butcher_lord_and_the/). And it wiill be for nothing. Because the quest is shallow to begin with. Becaue it's all self deception. The boy is not Rhaeghar's son.

The universe sends JonCon warnings, like Aegon's eyes being different color from Rhaegar (not a proof by any means, but an ominous sign) or Bittersteel's skull grinning at him (*""what does he have to smile about?""*  Griff wonders, and the answer is pretty obvious) but he ingores them.  He wants Aegon to be real. He needs Aegon to be real. Because otherwise, he's got nothing to live for.

Basically, i see JonCon's story as a greek tragedy of sorts. And i think Aegon being an impostor is necessary for it to work (as well as Rhaegar's real son, ironically also named Jon, being out there).

Another important thing -  Jon Connington is basically confirmed to be gay. GRRM mentioned that there is a gay POV in ADWD, and it's pretty obvious who it is:

>The bells tolled for all of us that day. For Aerys and his queen, for Elia of Dorne and her little daughter, for every true man and honest woman in the Seven Kingdoms. And for my silver prince.

&#x200B;

>He was young and full of pride. How not? King Aerys had named him Hand and given him an army, and he meant to prove himself worthy of that trust, of Rhaegar's love.

&#x200B;

>Jon Connington remembered Prince Rhaegar's wedding all too well. Elia was never worthy of him.

Connington was in love with Rhaegar. It's a key element of his story. He's not  helping Aegon because of pride, greed or duty. He's doing it because of love. His story is as tragic as it is romantic.  *I rose too high, loved too hard, dared too much. I tried to grasp a star, overreached, and fell.*

So how does Myles Toyne fits in all this? Well, there is a hint that Connington was romantically involved with him.

>""Tywin Lannister himself could have done no more,"" **he had insisted one night to Blackheart**, during his first year of exile.

&#x200B;

>His famous forebear, the dark and dashing Terrence Toyne of whom the singers sang, had been so fair of face that even the king's mistress could not resist him; but Myles had been possessed of jug ears, a crooked jaw, and the biggest nose that Jon Connington had ever seen. **When he smiled at you, though, none of that mattered.** Blackheart, his men had named him, for the sigil on his shield. Myles had loved the name and all it hinted at. ""A captain-general should be feared, by friend and foe alike,"" he had once confessed. ""If men think me cruel, so much the better."" The truth was otherwise. Soldier to the bone, Toyne was fierce but always fair, a father to his men and always generous to the exile lord Jon Connington.

Of course, none if this is definitive, but i feel this is enough to make a suggestion. At the very least, Toyne was  a close friend of Jon's. But probably more than that.

Also, gotta love that *""Myles had loved the name and all it hinted at"" line.* You have no idea how right you are, Jon.

And Jon beng romantically involved with Blackheart adds another level of tragedy to his story. A betrayal. He does not care for Illyrio and Varys, so their lies will not hurt him. But Myles?

Exiled, grieving and broken, Jon found some solace with Blackheart. But he lied to him, manipulated him and gave him false hope to further his agenda. Isn't this just perfect in it's tragedy? Isn't this exactly what GRRM would write?

I always valued these doylist arguments above watsonian, in-universe ones. Yes, Aegon *could* be the real deal. But he *shouldn't* be, because him being an impostor makes for a much better story. Him being a Blackfyre descendant in particular would be a great way to develop Illyrio's character, [to continue the Bloodraven-Bittersteel dynamic](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/96yd8f/spoilers_extended_old_wounds_never_heal_will/) and, of course, to add a great layer of tragedy to Jon Connington's story.

**TLDR: Myles Toyne being a captain of the Golden Compnay who made a pact to help Aegon is a hint towards the Blackfyre theory. Toyn's nickname and his love for** ***""all it hinted at""*** **reveals his true motives. And his friendship (and possibly romantic imvolvement) with Connington adds a great layer of tragedy to Griff's story.**",SPOILER
"Which is exactly how he tricked Jaime before his mutilation. He 'falls' for Jaime's bluff in keeping Brienne safe and then offers Jaime a Partridge on the fire, before chopping off his hand.

"There have been several excellent posts discussing the affect that Sansa has on various characters in the story. From Littlefinger to Sandor. I just wanted to share one of my favourite scenes that really highlight just how good at the Game of Thrones that Sansa is capable of being. 

&#x200B;

It happens on the way to the Purple Wedding. Sansa has recently lost most of her remaining family and has just been forcibly married into the  family responsible for all her suffering. Yet this is how Tyrion observes her as he leads her around the yard to perform the necessary courtesies, 

&#x200B;

> She is good at this, he thought, as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that  his cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown, and  question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His  cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first time he'd left his sickbed since the battle. He looks ghastly. Lancel's hair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick. Without his father beside him holding him up, he would surely have collapsed. **Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed.**  She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he'd had the sense to love her. He wondered if his nephew was capable of loving anyone 

&#x200B;

Its such a touching moment especially when you consider that Lancel is a *Lannister*. It clearly had a palpable effect on both Lancel and Kevan.

"* In the 1993 outline while ASOIAF was a trilogy, GRRM named the second volume A Dance with Dragons and dedicated it to Dany's invasion of Westeros with the Dothraki under her command.

* In the Appendix of AGoT where GRRM provided the Targaryen king list, he mentioned a civil war called Dance of Dragons between a male and a female Targaryen claimant. There was no mention of Blackfyre rebellions in this king list because they were not created yet. AGoT is also the book where Aegon's face getting smashed beyond recognition was mentioned too many times. As a result, it seems clear that when AGoT was published in 1996, GRRM had already decided that Dany's invasion should be a civil war between with another pretender who would claim to be Aegon.

* We would later learn that the factions in the Dance of Dragons were called blacks vs. greens. Interestingly, this color scheme is the direct juxtaposition of Tyrion's hetero-chromatic eyes as first described in AGoT. Again we later learned that GRRM is giving Tyrion a central role in this upcoming civil war between Dany and fAegon, which Moqorro foreshadowed as Tyrion snarling in the midst of all those dragons and casting a huge shadow.

* It is very easy to see that Team Dany will be the new blacks and Team fAegon will be the new greens in this upcoming conflict. This is more or less like a mirror image of the first Dance. But the invention of the Blackfyres as the origin story of fAegon spoiled this perfectly built color scheme. The Blackfyres used the black dragon in their banners and were called the black dragons. Black should have been reserved to Dany alone and fAegon should have stuck to green with Tyrion standing in the middle of them with his black and green eyes. Adding the black color to fAegon twisted the original color scheme.",SPOILER
"I am curious, is WoT good? Or worth the read? With a couple of obvious exceptions(ex: Lotr, Harry Potter(?)) Asoiaf is my first taste of fantasy.

So my question is, is WoT similar to Asoiaf, and is it a good story? It's what 14(?) books long? Is the story worth breaking down and spending the time reading that many novels? Are there similarities between the stories that would make it easier for me to transition to that story?

"##Intro

The introduction of Young Griff and his dramatic reveal as Aegon Targaryen, son of Rhaegar Targaryen, remains one of the more controversial decisions GRRM made in ASOIAF. Many readers see Young Griff and his storyline as ""filler material"" contributing to the bloat found in *A Dance with Dragons*. Other fans view Young Griff as an obvious red herring. And these perspectives of Young Griff as filler material and red herrings gained a bit of resonance in that this storyline was never featured in HBO's *Game of Thrones.* 

Even among readers who enjoyed Young Griff and Jon Connington's story in ADWD, they generally saw Young Griff's storyline as incomplete -- one that would payoff in *The Winds of Winter*. These fans (including myself) see Young Griff's narrative purpose as working towards a satisfying conclusion through Cersei, Arianne, Jon Connington and eventually Daenerys Targaryen's stories. 

But while I am more sympathetic to the latter interpretation, I've come to see an additional narrative virtue in Young Griff in the published books. And it's something I got the chance to talk on the NotACast patreon with /u/PoorQuentyn and /u/i_am_heathen_king. In the episode, we talked about how GRRM seemed to intentionally parallel Young Griff to Jon Snow, how GRRM wrote two competing narratives of the ""hidden prince"" trope in the forms of Jon and Young Griff (or the two Aegons, Right? *Right!?* Don't worry. I'll resign.) 

But one of the points we touched on is something on the meta side: how Young Griff's rise to prominence gives us a vision of what ASOIAF might have been had George RR Martin not abandoned the five-year gap.

You're already side-eyeing me, rolling your eyes and thinking *Here goes Brynden again*. I get that. I deserve your scorn. But I'm going to proceed anyways, because that's what heroes do.  
***
##The Five Year Gap and Training Montages

For the four or five people who don't know what the five-year gap is, the five-year gap was a planned time-skip that George RR Martin planned to occur between *A Storm of Swords* and *A Dance with Dragons*. The intent behind this jump in the timeline was to age the Stark kids up and push the narrative towards the action sequences that GRRM really wanted to get to.

(If you'd like to get in deep on the Five-Year Gap, why not check out a [2-hour long episode of the Maester Monthly podcast](https://maestermonthly.wordpress.com/2017/05/22/maester-monthly-episode-iv-the-five-year-gap/) where I joined likely-criminals /u/glass_table_girl, /u/bookshelfstud, /u/admiralkird, /u/-Sam-R- and /u/joemagician to talk about the Five-Year Gap?)

Anyhow, GRRM wrote several hundred pages of material with five-year gap in mind for about a year and a half. But then he abandoned the idea altogether, announcing this major change at WorldCon 2001:

> He said that he started writing the book set several years after the events of the last book but after he was several hundred pages in he decided that that just wasn't working; that he had to leave too much out. - [SSM, 2/14/2003](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1289)

In the years since he abandoned the gap, Martin has given reasons why he abandoned the gap to the tune of:

- Important events occurred in the five years and couldn't be properly told in flashback. - [So Spake Martin 2001](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1268) 
- It was difficult to do flashbacks of all the people Cersei killed in the past five years. - [So Spake Martin, 2005](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/US_Signing_Tour_Half_Moon_Bay_CA/)
- GRRM wanted to deal with the immediate reaction of Dorne to the death of Oberyn Martell and couldn't make it work with a Five-Year Gap. - [So Spake Martin, 2002](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1281)

These were all excellent, plot-driven reasons why GRRM abandoned the gap, but in a 2013 interview with Charlie Jane Anders of io9 and Observation Deck, Martin addressed something else, a reason why he thought of the five-year gap in the first place:

> [The gap] worked well with some characters like Arya ""î who at end the of Storm of Swords has taken off for Braavos. You can come back five years later, and she has had five years of training and all that. Or Bran, who was taken in by the Children of the Forest and the green ceremony, [so you could] come back to him five years later. That's good. Works for him. - [GRRM, Observation Deck Interview, 7/23/2013](https://observationdeck.kinja.com/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-unedited-interview-886117845)

Essentially, GRRM could push the narrative forward so that Bran could be a full warg and skinchanger, and Arya would emerge from the five-year gap as a fully-trained Faceless Man assassin. GRRM wanted to get to fun stuff of Bran and Arya. Pushing the timeline ahead allowed him to skip the ""boring"", training steps in the narrative progression.

But then Martin talked about why abandoning the five-year gap was good. It was all about character development and showing Arya and Bran in training:

> Character development and [people] changing is good, and there are some tough things in there that I think a lot of writers skip over. I'm glad I didn't skip over these things. [For example], things that Arya is learning. The things Bran is learning. Learning is not inherently an interesting thing to write about. It's not an easy thing to write about. - [GRRM, Observation Deck Interview, 7/23/2013](https://observationdeck.kinja.com/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-unedited-interview-886117845)

Foregoing the training side also forced Martin to write difficult leadership arcs for Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen too. As he noted in the interview:

> ... And that has been interesting, you know. Jon Snow as Lord Commander. Dany as Queen, struggling with rule. 

> Seeing someone like Dany actually trying to deal with the vestments of being a queen and getting factions and guilds and [managing the] economy. They burnt all the fields [in Meereen]. They've got nothing to import any more. They're not getting any money. - [GRRM, Observation Deck Interview, 7/23/2013](https://observationdeck.kinja.com/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-unedited-interview-886117845)

Of course, many readers *still* look askance at Jon and Dany's ADWD arcs. And while I'm not here to change anyone's (wrong) opinion that Dany and Jon's ADWD storylines are bad, I do think it's worth understanding why GRRM invested the time in Dany and Jon's painful leadership arcs in ADWD: Martin wanted to demonstrate these characters' *character growth* over 23 ADWD chapters.

But there's a character introduced in ADWD who doesn't endure a difficult pathway or narrative progression. Of course, as you've read the title: **It's Young Griff.**
***
##The Young Griff Training Montage

Let's start at the end with Varys' super-villain speech to Kevan Lannister in the ADWD Epilogue:

> '""Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them."" (ADWD, Epilogue)

Pretty stirring speech, right? Young Griff has been shaped to rule, trained in sword-fightin', he's been educated, is literate, knows about the Faith of the Seven, lived among the smallfolk of Essos, can cook and clean up nice. 

But do we see Young Griff doing any of that in ADWD? Well, to be fair, yes. Some of it at least. Long before Varys crowsbows the shit out of Kevan, Tyrion observes Young Griff aboard the Shy Maid learning history and politics factoids from Half-Maester Haldon, getting drilled in the use of swords by Rolly Duckfield and deciphering the mysteries of the Faith of the Seven from Septa Lemore. And that's all captured in about **seven paragraphs** in ADWD, Tyrion IV. 

And because I'm the fairest person around (everyone says this ... *they don't actually say this.*), Tyrion sums up his observations to Half-Maester Haldon:

> ""The boy is bright. You have done well by him. Half the lords in Westeros are not so learned, sad to say. Languages, history, songs, sums ... a heady stew for some sellsword's son."" (ADWD, Tyrion IV)

But does that Young Griff training montage lead readers to the conclusion that *""Hell yeah. Make this guy king!""*? I can't speak for everyone, but for me, it's a resounding no. Sure, Young Griff might have the education pedigree for the role, but that's really it.

And when push comes to shove, and stone men attack the Shy Maid as it passes under the Bridge of Dream, where Young Griff can use at least one of his talents that he learned during his training montage, the boy has an interesting reaction:

> The broken bone was speckled with brown blood, but still he lurched forward, reaching for Young Griff. His hand was grey and stiff, but blood oozed between his knuckles as he tried to close his fingers to grasp. The boy stood staring, as still as if he too were made of stone. His hand was on his sword hilt, but he seemed to have forgotten why. (ADWD, Tyrion V)

Now, that's not to damn the poor kid for freezing when a monster attacks necessarily. But it's a meta signal on GRRM's part that maybe this kid isn't all he's cracked up to be by Varys and Illyrio. 

Extending that out a bit: Maybe it's not training montages and fast-forwarding to the interesting parts of the plot that make for a story we care about all that much. Fans might be right in not giving much of a damn about Young Griff's story. We haven't been with him for five books. We haven't seen his training. We spend all of six chapters with him in ADWD. 

Perhaps that's a bit intentional on Martin's part. George might be showing readers what the story would have looked like with a five-year gap: a bit of a letdown -- even though within the space of two Tyrion chapters, we're thrust into a spooky action sequence. Why we're not invested in the action and character of Young Griff is part of the reason why the character exists in the narrative.

Young Griff hasn't had three books where he's trained for rule or learned through hardship, pain and loss. All of that training was done in the background. It's a montage. 
***
##Jon and Daenerys in ADWD: Anti-Training Montages

Contrast Young Griff to Jon and Daenerys in ADWD. We've watched their character growth and observed their training arcs in the first three books of ASOIAF. And in ADWD itself, GRRM writes their character development through extraordinarily difficult leadership pathways. 

Jon has to deal with problems of wildling integration south of the Wall, the possibility everyone might starve if they don't ration food, negotiating a loan agreement with the Iron Bank, how to deal with Stannis, Melisandre the Queen's Men and the presence of R'hllor and above all that: the threat of apocalypse via the Others. He fucks up. He makes mistakes. He does good things too. But he's growing, learning, **advancing in his character development.**

Similarly for Daenerys, she's endured a ton of shit to get where she is. Tyrion makes this point explicit to Young Griff in their cyvasse game:

> ""I know that she spent her childhood in exile, impoverished, living on dreams and schemes, running from one city to the next, always fearful, never safe, friendless but for a brother who was by all accounts half-mad ""¶ a brother who sold her maidenhood to the Dothraki for the promise of an army. I know that somewhere out upon the grass her dragons hatched, and so did she. I know she is proud. How not? What else was left her but pride? I know she is strong. How not? The Dothraki despise weakness. If Daenerys had been weak, she would have perished with Viserys. I know she is fierce. Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen are proof enough of that. She has crossed the grasslands and the red waste, survived assassins and conspiracies and fell sorceries, grieved for a brother and a husband and a son, trod the cities of the slavers to dust beneath her dainty sandaled feet. (ADWD, Tyrion VI) 

As readers, we've seen Dany and Jon go through their (sometimes literal) trials by fire both on the training and leadership sides.

And that's really where we see a form of what the five-year gap might have looked like. At the end of five years, Jon and Daenerys would have been established leaders in their respective realms. They would be older, wiser, able to more easily navigate through the difficulties of rule. Varys' ADWD monologue about Young Griff could have easily applied to Jon or Daenerys after a five-year gap. 

Of course, readers wouldn't have seen Jon negotiating a loan with the Iron Bank or Daenerys trying to peacefully resolve the civil war in Meereen through marrying Hizdahr zo Loraq. We wouldn't have seen Jon's agonizing decision-making process on what to do with Stannis or gotten a full chapter on Daenerys making the terrible decision to close the gates of Meereen to plague-victims from Astapor.

In fact, we know for certain that Martin's original plan for Daenerys with the five-year gap in mind was that her opening chapter would be what eventually became ADWD, Daenerys IX: the chapter where Drogon returns at Daznak's Pit:

> There's a Dany scene in the book which is actually one of the oldest chapters in the book that goes back almost ten years now. When I was contemplating the five year gap [Martin laughs here, with some chagrin], that chapter was supposed to be the first Daenerys chapter in the book. Then it became the second chapter, and then the third chapter, and it kept getting pushed back as I inserted more things into it. I've rewritten that chapter so much that it ended in many different ways. - [So Spake Martin, 2011](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/5431/)

In my opinion, GRRM made the correct decision to abandon the five-year gap and continue the advancement of Dany and Jon's arcs, picking the story up immediately from their dramatic conclusions in ASOS. It keeps audiences invested their stories. So when Dany and Jon move into some thrilling heroics (and horrors) in TWOW, that payoff will be felt much more strongly than any payoffs associated with Young Griff's storyline both in ADWD and on into TWOW/ADOS.
***
##Conclusion

Towards the end of the Charlie Jane Anders interview, Martin talked about a topic that has become a bit of a meme in the fandom: Aragorn:

> There is a sense when you're writing something in high fantasy, you're in a dialogue with all the other high fantasy writers that have written. And there is always this presumption that if you are a good man, you will be a good king. [Like] Tolkien ""î in Return of the King, Aragorn comes back and becomes king, and then [we read that] ""he ruled wisely for three hundred years."" Okay, fine. It is easy to write that sentence, '""He ruled wisely""ù.

That's the story that Varys and Illyrio want to tell about Young Griff: *he's been trained, he'll rule wisely.* And all of that training can just be papered away with a few paragraphs of exposition, a monologue or ... *a five-year gap.* 

In contrast, GRRM put time and effort into what ""ruling wisely"" means in the form of Jon and Daenerys. (He also put time and effort into what ""ruling *unwisely* means in the form of Cersei in King's Landing). And that's excellent. It's good that we spend time in Meereen and Castle Black before Daenerys and Jon get back into their action phases. It's good that we see the hard work of leadership displayed in their arcs. We, as readers, need this to continue our investment in Jon and Dany.

But if you're feeling unsatisfied with Jon and Dany's stories in ADWD, look at the alternative: Young Griff. I enjoy his story as much as any fan. I've written a fair amount about it - including this piece - but there's no real emotional investment in Young Griff. We don't care all that much about his story. And I'd venture that if a five-year gap had been in place for Jon and Dany, we might not have cared as much about their stories -- had Martin not made the correct decision to abandon the five-year gap and done the hard work of writing grueling leadership arcs for them.

"I'm aware this has probably been heavily discussed here, but I've just been watching some videos about some supposed flashbacks we may see in season 8. What do you guys want to see?

Personally I would like to see flashbacks of the Targaryens in power, as we've never really seen the Targaryen-Rule era on screen. I'm talking tourneys, King's Landing with dragon banners, and so on. I would also live to see flashbacks telling the story of Rhaegar and Lyanna, including Rhaegar crowning her as queen of love and beauty, Rhaegar riding off to war, the Battle of the Trident and Rhaegar vs Robert, etc.

I would also like to see some flashbacks of the mad king, perhaps him having Rickard and Brandon killed, and possibly even the sack of King's Landing. This is probably all wishful thinking, but I definitely believe it would add a great deal to the end-game if we could see these events.

Let me know what you're all hoping for, now that it's drawing ever closer!",SPOILER
"At the time of Robert's death, Robert intended Joffrey to succeed him and specifically gave his written words to Ned.  Ned changed King's  words while writing them down.  Joffrey did not wrong there, Robert is the father he looks up to, and Robert loved him to Tim his death.  



Is John any less a son to Ned then Joffrey is to Robert? 




Its true that Robert might have changed his mind if he knew about the incest, but that's still for Robert to decide.  Joffrey for all intends and purposes is his heir.  And all Ned had was a guess from hair colors. 


How is that not a coup? Think about it from Joffrey's POV: his dad just died. Dad's best friend, The Hand and his future wife's   father is trying to declare him illegitimate and steal his rightful crown.  


Ned sure as hell knew that denying Joffrey will result in an all out war, thousands of dead and all.  Most of it all could have been avoided if he wasn't as stubborn. 



Ned later announced for Joffrey in chains, to save his daughters' lives.  Only if he valued lives of the common people  the same, he might have avoided major war.



Edit: 


Even Ned knows he is wrong there. 



>Robert¬†""¶""ù Joffrey is not your son, he wanted to say, but the words would not come. The agony was written too plainly across Robert's face; he could not hurt him more. So Ned bent his head and wrote, but where the king had said my son Joffrey,""ù he scrawled '""my heir""ù instead. The deceit made him feel soiled. The lies we tell for love, he thought. May the gods forgive me. '""What else would you have me say?""ù

"1. I'm very excited for the final season of the show. For some of us, this means the end of suffering. We have seen the destruction of the foundations of structure, narrative, character development and motivations of every aspect of the books we love. Though, I'm having fun watching the series, it not represents the depth of the one of the greatest stories of our generation. So, in my own point of view, I'm glad this farce is over.
2. A few years ago I had conversation with people working on Penguin Random House about the distribution of ASOIAF books in Latin America, (we had the chance to meet GRRM  in Mexico), and some people believed, at that time,  that GRRM editors had a signed contract to don't publish anything about the main ASOIAF story until HBO series is over. So, if any of this is true, the following months after GOT finale, will be exciting.
3. Anyway, despite all of my anger and frustration feelings about how bad the show have become, I'm aware that these were glorious years for the fantasy genre. We have seen how people who were afraid or nervous to show in public their love of knights, dragons, wizards, swords and more, have overcome criticism and become the central focus of all media. GOT have normalized fantasy. And not just us, all the filmmakers, writers, musicians, journalists, explorers, photographers, all people living their lives influenced by fictional characters living in a cruel world. What a great time to be alive.
4. I'm really interested in the new HBO production because maybe we can see another aspect of the world of ASOIAF. And I'm excited to see a story created just for TV and not an adaptation. I think this new series will show a very different aspect of what GOT has become: fearless and without limitations.
5. Finally, I'm glad that we can all connect in here, this is the best community even if we have different opinions about the show and some of you don't think Stannis will free the Northi. And maybe I would not be here if the show didn't existed. Thank you friends of reddit, I hope you enjoy the last season as you like.",SPOILER
"Heya,  

I'm a long time lurker/infrequent poster here on r/asoiaf. I've been reading theories on this sub for years now... basically ever since I finished ASOIAF and started asking the Internet what is Jaqen after, what are the Others up to, who wrote the Pink letter, and what's Euron's plan?  
  
Anyway a friend of mine recently finished ADWD and being the nerd that I am I decided to gather up the the most interesting theories I've found over the years. I've organized them in such a way so that they form an overall narrative on a particular character/topic to help paint a picture of what's likely to unfold in future installments of the series we all love.  
  
Here's what I've gathered together so far. Enjoy!

"What theories will probably never be killed ( neither confirmed , nor disproved )    

For example , Bolt-on  , we will never get confirmation.  Unless there is a weird scene where after Ramsay kills his father , his eyes becomes more pale then before  and he starts talking with much softer voice ... which makes too obvious ..   
Or maybe Roose will make some Bond villain  confession about his ""special gifts""?   well ... no ...  George will never write such scene.    But we probably will never get any hard proof that this theory is 100% false.

"This is a bit tinfoil but remember all the skeletons in the three eyed ravens cave? What if they were sacrifices (like potentially jojen paste) that somehow fuel the weirwood trees' ability to give bran power. The red god also demands sacrifice, sacrifice to power something surely, AND is opposed to the white walkers like bran's crew. The many faced god also demands sacrifices but for what? It must go towards a power that is more than just ""getting new faces for assassins."" 

With a grain of salt, it can be assumed that bran's crew, red god, many faced god all demand sacrifices to power the same thing 


There are other connections between these three factions. Red priests can change appearance like worshippers of the many faces god. There are many weirwood faces (similar to the many faced god? What if the many faced god is the one that commands these faces, in this case it would be bran. Maybe it's not bran himself that makes him so powerful, its power through sacrifice.

Dany while drinking the shade of the evening made from jet black trees with ink blue leaves -


""Dany raised the glass to her lips. The **first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat, foul,** but when she swallowed, it seemed to come to life within her. She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest, like fingers of fire coiling around her heart, and **on her tongue the taste was like honey** and anise and cream, **like mother's milk** and Drogo's seed, like red meat and hot blood and molten gold. It was like all the tastes she had ever known, and none of them . . . **and then the glass was empty.**""ù




Bran while eating the Weirwood paste made from white weirwoods with reddish leaves -



'""It had a bitter taste, though not so bitter as the acorn paste. **The first spoonful was the hardest to get down**. He almost retched it right back up. The second tasted better. The third was almost sweet. The rest he spooned up eagerly. Why had he thought that it was bitter? **It tasted of honey**, of new-fallen snow, of pepper and cinnamon and the **last kiss his mother gave him**. **The empty bowl slipped from his fingers** and clattered on the floor.""ù

"Let's take a look at the conflict between Renly and Stannis Baratheon. Both want the Iron Throne, and badly. Renly has lots of allies; nobody likes Stannis. Renly, somewhat understandably, thinks this means he should be king. And, you know what? Maybe he's right. Maybe the adoration of the realm can make for the kind of stability that Westeros has been missing since before the First Blackfyre Rebellion.

But do you know what's not great for a prospective king? I'll tell you: it's OPENING UP A SECOND FRONT IN A WAR THATS APREADY DIFFICULT TO WIN. A FRONT ON WHICH VICTORY REQUIRES YOU TO KILL YOUR OLDER BROTHER TO JUMP AHEAD OF HIM IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION WHEN YOU COULD NOT DO THAT AND BECOME KING WITHOUT ANY KINSLAYING. At first glance, Renly is right to reject Stannis' terms: after all, he commands the much larger force. But what he forgets is that, even if he isn't murdered by a smoke baby, beating Stannis will cost time and resources that could make a big difference when facing off against Tywin Lannister (just think what Tywin pulls together at the last minute against Stannis at the Blackwater). 

On the other hand, the terms Stannis offers Renly feature the following:

-Continued ownership of one of the realm's largest castles

-A seat on Stannis' small council

-BEING NEXT IN LINE TO THE THRONE WHEN THE KING HAS NEITHER SONS NOR, SEEMINGLY, THE DESIRE TO MAKE ANY WITH HIS CURRENT WIFE.

This idiocy staggers me. By essentially just agreeing to be king at a later date that is not right this second, Renly can all but guarantee a Baratheon victory against the Lannisters. Hell, You could even take the offer and assassinate Stannis later. Just think, Renly... oh what was that...? You can't think because you're dead? Whatever, I tried.

Tl;dr: If Renly bends the knee to Stannis, he becomes heir to a king who's all but guaranteed not to produce any heirs to supersede him. Renly's dumb.

"So I've been reading up on the ""Bran is the Night King"" theory. My wife and I just watched S4E2, and I'm convinced that this episode gives some of the most adamant foreshadowing I've seen yet. There are two distinct scenes that are almost dead giveaways to me:

1) Bran is warging into Summer for extended periods of time. When he is woken up by Jojen and Meera, they warn him that he should not stay warged into Summer for extended periods of time, as staying in another's body for too long may cause him to forget everything about who he is. 

2) [Bran's vision](http://i.imgur.com/pHVfJrs.png). I've seen a lot of speculation about this particular part of his vision and trying to figure out who the second person is. But what I think people are missing is that this is clearly a *reflection* of the Night King - as in, Bran is seeing himself as the Night King (he just doesn't know it yet). 

Apologies if these points have been discussed already regarding this theory, but I didn't see either of these brought up when I was reading up on the theory. Thoughts? ",SPOILER

"Robert Strong is dead, isn't he? we saw when he fought the sparrows that he doesn't need his organs anymore (at least not an immediate sense) to keep fighting.

What does the Walker prove to anybody?

And don't tell me nobody knew Robert Strong was a dead man, its utterly obvious. First of all he is the exact same height and build as Gregor Clegane, who had just died; and nobody knew of his existence before Gregor died. That alone is pretty much proof to anyone with half a brain that Robert and Gregor are the same guy. 

And Robert is obviously ""dead"" in some manner, even if we ignore the book quotes about him never eating or shitting, he NEVER vocalizes. I don't care what kind of vow you take, a living man grunts when he snaps a neck or takes two spikes to the chest.

"Anybody who believes that Valyrias fall was caused by all their volcanoes going off after reading about Princess Aerea should think about the fall again. Am telling you, after reading up on her death, I'm sure that the Valyrians were reading up on some Lovecraft style demon summoning that went wrong in a bid for more power (as if having hundreds, if not thousands, of dragons at the time wasn't enough)

Hearing about her death and what came out of her body, I'm pretty sure that some demon fuckery of the lesser 40k kind is now making its home on Valyria. The literal doom could be anything from some unwanted void spawn to some giant Demon dragon for all we know. Volcanoes going off? Merely a symptom. Whatever caused them to go off is the fucking disease. Just what it is (and how Euron Greyjoy managed to avoid it) is beyond me. Then again, Euron only ""visited"" Valyria. From what I've read and heard, Princess Aerea was there for more than half of or a full year before she got back and was already dying from whatever burning worms were coming out of her (Goddamnit George! As if your world wasn't bleak enough)

But seriously, it would take the Emperor of Mankind and his custodes landing on good all Westeros to clear that damn world of all it's fucked up horror shit.

Sorthoryos has its Dark gods and Brindlemen. Valyria has some demons having a party on it every day. Don't even ask me what going on in and beyond Asshai and Westeros has its damn ice zombies and and Ice dragons in the shivering sea.

It's a really bleak world in a Song of ice and fire when you think about it.

Daemon Targaryen organizing the murder of prince jaeharys.
He did not obey Tywins rule of. '""Never wound a man if you do not mean to kill him. For dead men take no revenge""ù 
How? When he did the blood and cheese murder, he had them kill jaehaerys. They allowed helaena to be able to identify them and get them caught. + miss out on valuable kills. What should they have done?
1. Kill alicent Hightower.
2. Kill all the children in the room.
3 remove Helaena Targaryens tongue.
4 removed enough of her fingers that it would be impossible for her to Write at all. Than she could not identify blood and cheese.
This would have greatly damaged Aegons cause and would have made it easier for the blacks to win.
I will answer a question that will likely be asked here.why not just kill Helaena. Not killing her means Aegon is still married to her and therefore cannot have sons with someone else. As well as this would make him very angry. When people are angry they do not think clearly and could not plan a war as well.

"I've recently been writing of the Ender Quartet and its connections to ASOIAF. In the same vein, I am going to introduce Dan Simmons' *Hyperion Cantos* with an eye toward the labyrinths scattered around Westeros.

In the Hyperion series, the Shrike and its effigies are described in symbolic language similar to that of the Iron Throne. Much like the Others, the Shrike is an unknown entity that seems to only want the destruction of humanity -- but its true motives are unknown. Simmons used the term weirwood seven years before Martin published the first ASOIAF book. Their advanced version of the internet is accessed through tubes that lock into a person's skull by way of a 'cortical shunt'. This mirrors the manner the weirwoodnet works and how the roots snake through the bodies of Bloodraven and the other greenseers in the cave. Characters sometimes communicate through hyperreal dreams across time and space, similar to some of the prophetic dreams in ASOIAF. There are heavy themes regarding the nature of sacrifice as well as smaller connections littered throughout.

As for the labyrinths:

>Nine worlds have labyrinths... The labyrinths were dug... tunneled... *created* more than three quarters of a million standard years ago. **The details were inevitably the same, their origins inevitably unsolved.** Labyrinthine worlds are always Earthlike, at least to 7.9 on the Solmev scale, always circling a G-type star, and yet **always restricted to worlds that are tectonically dead**... No suggestion of heavy metals or precious ores has been sufficient to explain such a monumental effort. **No legend or artifact of the Labyrinth builders has survived.**

>-Hyperion

>The labyrinths honeycombed those nine worlds -- Hyperion included -- and **served no known purpose**.

>The labyrinths fueled numerous myths...but their mystery remained.

>-Endymion

The labyrinths are chiefly defined by their mystery. These mysteries revolve around the labyrinths themselves and their purpose as well as the nature of whoever created these labyrinths. We see the same mysteries surrounding the mazes and 'mazemakers' of the world of Westeros. These mazemakers are said in the World Book to have left no written records on the purpose of their mazes.

>Most maesters accept the common wisdom that declares it to be of Valyrian construction... but underground, we are told, endless labyrinths of tunnels lead to vast chambers, and carved steps descend hundreds of feet into the earth. **No man can say who might have built these cities, or when. They remain perhaps the only remnant of some vanished people.**

>-The Bones and Beyond: Leng, TWOIAF

>In ancient days, the isles were home to the mysterious race of men known as the mazemakers, who vanished long before the dawn of true history, **leaving no trace of themselves save for their bones and the mazes they built.**

>-The Free Cities: Lorath, TWOIAF

The terms volcano and earthquake have no use in the Westerosi world from natural movements of the Earth. Volcano doesn't appear in the search and earthquake is used once to describe a character's movements. The closest we get to a volcano comes from the World Book and the Doom of Valyria, described as ""a catastrophic explosion caused by the eruption of all Fourteen Flames together."" This indicates a magical reason for this eruption, not a tectonic reason. Should this reference be more direct as I am suggesting, this would mean Westeros is also a tectonically dead world. 

The only time landmasses shift would be due to large-scale magical events of old, such as the Breaking. This event is said to have broken the arm of Dorne as well as attempted to separate the north and south of Westeros by striking at the Neck.",SPOILER
"Been a while since I've read the books, so most of my memory is from the show which I know leaves out a ton of detail.

Or why Littlefingers great grandfather decided to be a landed noble owning a small piece of land that was practically worthless.

"The murder of Prince Jaehaerys by Blood and Cheese is probably one of the most gruesome acts that the Blacks (unambiguously) committed during the Dance. It wasn't until reading F&B that I actually understood why it was done in the way it was. 

&#x200B;

In the pages before it is mentioned that Queen Rhaenyra CHOSE which routes her sons Jace and Luke would fly  on their diplomatic missions. She sent Jace on the longer mission with more perceived dangers, visiting four different noble houses that could betray him and the dangers he could have faced on the way. Luke was explicitly sent on the shorter, safer, route to the son of a close ally whose support was not particularly in question. Queen Rhaenyra chose which of the two was going to go where, thinking she was keeping one safe when she actually sent him to his death. Rhaenyra probably spent the rest of her life questioning whether both of her sons would have lived if she had chose differently and that Luke's death was entirely on her. 

&#x200B;

Thus the Blood and Cheese murder paid back Luke's murder in more ways than one in its structure. 1. A son for a son is the most obvious and direct parallel. 2. That the Queen had to choose which one would live and which one would die, the same as her half-sister. 3. That the one the Queen thought she was saving was not the one who actually would be saved. All of this shows Daemon's own understanding of justice that is similar to an older understanding of crime and punishment. The punishment of the murder of Luke fit the crime directly in every way that was possible. (I'm still not saying it was the good thing to do. Just that I understand why it was done this way a bit more.)",SPOILER
"I'm going to preface this clearly: I LOVED F&B and honestly am looking forward to F&B2 as much as I am WoW. I understand the narrative hypothesis and how it works and I understand how George had to give us information in a certain way so that we could have it.

With that in mind I did notice a few places where Gyldayn gives us information that no one really could have had (or he doesn't mention how he could have gotten it.)

&#x200B;

The big two examples are these ones.

1. The Myrman that killed Aemon the Prince of Dragonstone. It's mentioned that the crossbowman who killed Aemon was aiming at the man next to Aemon. He then goes on to tell how Baelon the Spring Prince ripped the invasion force a new one and killed everybody. Without stopping to mention if Aemon's assassin had been captured and interrogated to provide the knowledge that he hadn't actually been shooting at the Targaryen intentionally. Not a particularly important detail, but still the narrative as written doesn't give a way that anyone could know who that crossbow bolt was supposed to kill.
2. It's written that Aegon II burnt all of Gaemon Palehair's 'ridiculous' edicts. Yet, Gyldayn can list them in detail. Obviously Mushroom, Eustace, and Orwyle all could have been paying attention enough to note what this crazy kid's whore mothers were announcing, or Orwyle could have written them down before Aegon cast them into the fire.

So essentially here are two things I noticed that don't really line up with the documentation as well, I'm wondering if you all noticed any more instances like this?",SPOILER

"We are told from almost the beginning that Tywin is three things 1. A great strategist 2. A pragmatist 3. One of the greatest Hands that Westeros has ever seen. What I would like to discuss is how none of these things are actually true. 

First the myth of Tywin as a great strategist his listed wars are the War of the Ninepenny Kings (Where he didn't have a command.) the Tarbecks-Reyne Revolt, the Defiance of Duskendale, Robert's Rebellion and the War of the Five Kings. In none of these did he win (or fight.) a battle where he had a numerical inferiority and during his last war he lost a battle against Edmure Tully. He didn't really win the War of the Five Kings with his strategy but by luck. He was lucky that the Greyjoys were so stupid and that Theon's stupidity would cause Catelyn and Robb to make two unpredictable mistakes, and then lucky again that his loss to Tully gave him a chance to team up with the Tyrells at the Blackwater. As the later books show even his '""strategy""ù of the Red Wedding had no actually long term benefit to his rule. 

2. His treatment of the last Tarbecks (Elyn's two daughters and granddaughter.) isn't really pragmatic in that it contradicts with Tywin's other statement about helping people who bow to him rise again (can we think of any examples where he actually does this?) and keeping the mines of Castamere closed doesn't give him a benefit unless he has some other silver mines we don't know about. 

3. His reputation as a great hand only really comes from his removing Egg's reforms (things that were probably along the lines of Gaemon Palehair's edicts That Gyldayn dislikes in F&B.) and basically keeping things running half smoothly. There weren't any big projects or anything like in Jaehaerys I's reign and his treatment of Duskendale was basically sacrifice the king for the crown prince.

So in summation Tywin isn't that good of a strategist or a Hand at all. Thoughts? ",SPOILER
"So, I had watched the show and am now reading through the books, and I have been struck by how bitchy Tyrion consistently acts towards his father.

Or, ""Did you forget your dwarf son again.""  I mean i understand why he is pissed at the man, but surely holding his tongue would be more effective politically.  I think one of the things that sets the books apart from the show is how much more layered every character is, but Tyrion playing the whiney son makes me respect him a lot less. ",SPOILER

"I've been thinking about this a bit cause of a re-read.

Through out my time reading ASOIAF I was always picture Jaime as a lithe, 6'2"" pretty boy. Cut and muscular but not brawny etc. and with his comparisons to Cersei and curly hair in my mind a teenage Jamie Lannister would like a more masculine and handsome version of [Jay Alvarrez](https://s3.amazonaws.com/next-management-production/assets/images/203050/large_portrait.jpg?1399043119)

But I don't think that's the case, I think Jaime is fucking big and jacked in ASOIAF in GRRMs mind.

It starts with Jaime's own thinking about how he is one of the strongest men in Westeros bested only by guys who are 6'8""+

And because I grew up around shows like Dragon Ball I thought he meant stronger as in better swordsman, like how Goku is stronger than Vegeta because he is a better fighter lol

But on a re-read I noticed that Jaime distinctly names two other skills(speed, dexterity? i don't recall the second) meaning that he is talking about strength as in bench press, etc.

And then I read that GRRM thinks Aagorn would be beaten by Jamie, well as Aargorn is 6'6"" and crazy strong that seems ludicrous... If you're thinking of Jamie as I did.

I just realized now, very late, that Jamie is probably a lot closer to a 6'4"" badass Viking warrior in terms of looks than a pretty boy with a good sword. 

So what do you think of him in the books, beside NCW?",SPOILER
"
Hey mates,

Pretty much exactly what the title said. I'm already deeply invested in the lore of the world of ASOFAI courtesy of HBO, and so don't need the introduction and hook starting with A Game of Thrones would provide for someone new to the story altogether.

I get the feeling the expanded lore and encyclopedic information might help offer more context to the vast world-building and thousands of characters I'm about to explore, but I suppose the opposite side of that is it might rob me of some cool moments of revelation and dot-connecting that reading through in publication order would offer.

Regardless, I'm excited to finally be jumping down the rabbit hole. I had always said I was going to read all of the books, but it was always a sort of hollow resolution, like, ""I'm going to write a memoir"", or ""I'm totally going to stop drinking"". I've been rewatching the HBO series in anticipation of the final season, however, and my long-time seething contempt for how the one true king, Stannis Baratheon, was treated has finally boiled over into a need to see him in a world where, win or lose, his story is finished with the respect it deserves... In another ten years, when Winds of Winter finally comes out.

tl;dr If I'm already invested in the books due to the show, should I start with the main series or the supplements and *Fire and Blood*?

Cheers! <3",SPOILER
"I think it's generally accepted that the majority of fans were disappointed with how the TV series handled Dorne and excluded the fAegon storyline. 

We know D&D wanted to streamline some of the storylines, a seen in Sansa's arc in Season 5. I was not against the change, and I wish they had streamlined fAegon's story with Dornes. I propose that fAegon should've been a part of Doran's master plan.

Tyrion is brought to Dorne by Varys as he intends for Tyrion to be a part of fAegon's great council. As in the books, Tyrion convinces fAegon to begin his attack on Westeros, while he travels to Meereen to enlist Dany to their cause. However, Tyrion knows Dany will most likely not agree to marry fAegon as he has a better claim to the Iron Throne, and Tyrion is suspicious of fAegon's legitimacy. 

I would've preferred the show to delve into Tyrion's dark side after the events of Season 4. He is furious at his family and wants to see them suffer, at the moment, so he is sending two great enemies at them. 

So what do you guys think? ",SPOILER
"The scene where falia is dragged out has been confusing me for a  little while. If she was brought out, stripped naked and dragged out, why does she have no injuries from being forced out of her clothes? My theory is she is supposed to survive the kraken ritual. Euron is imitating daenerys but offering less so he will get something less powerful then a dragon. A kraken. She replaces Daenerys and therefore will survive just like her. What does this have to do with what I said earlier? I think euron warged her. She presumably tried to resist him and as a '""punishment""ù he made her undress herself and than present herself to his men/the 2 sons who brought her out. Maybe he made her beat herself before she came out as well and then told her that he could know everything she thinks or does and that if she ever says or does something without him telling her to, he would make her beat herself far worse. (The theorized beating I talked about here would have had to been mild or aeron would have noticed injuries) but this would explain why she was showing no resistance and had been broken so quickly. It would also be the only way her arms wouldn't have been hurt if they were forcing the clothing off. What does this have to do with eurons plan? It's possible that he will warg her for a variety of purposes. It could be to talk to people when it would be better then as euron. E.g to obtain information that wouldn't be given to euron as he is an enemy where falia is just a girl. E.g in kings landing or other places that euron couldn't go but needs information about. Why break her so badly? It would be easier if she offers no resistance and that is easier if she retains no will or identity of her own. Which would be easy to do to her via warging to read thoughts. As for why she didn't talk to aeron she is either too scared or broken to notice him or she is afraid that euron will make her hurt herself again or something. I believe that this theory will explain why falia was offering no resistance to eurons sons and showed no injuries from either being beaten into submission or having her clothes forced off + why she didn't talk to aeron




TL:DR 
euron warged falia to break her will and identity so that he can use her to obtain information that he cannot obtain as euron. Such as from kings landing or places fighting him where a 18 year old girl wouldn't be suspected.",SPOILER
"The History of the Night's Watch is a proud one - founded after the wall was built (8000 years ago?), 19 castles all fortified, an order where fathers were proud to send their sons. The question is why? In all of those 8000 years there were no White Walkers, no mystical/magical beings attacking the Night's Watch. All the men of the Night's Watch had to do was mount a defense against a few thousand wildlings (utterly lacking in technology and organization). As the decline of the Night's Watch seems to be relatively recent (within the last few decades/centuries) what did the numerous men of the Night's Watch actually do for thousands of years? Why did they need 19 castles?

"Sorry for the shitpost.  I assume this has been covered a few thousand times, but it's Monday and I'm bored at work.

Which character would you like to see portrayed on TV?

- Either a new character to the show
- A character who didn't get much screen time

 or 

- A character who you'd like to see portrayed differently.

My picks are:

- Barriston Selmy, but in his younger, prime years.  As one of the highest regarded kings guardsmen, I'd love to see some of his epic battles in his early years.

- Arthur Dane.  Considered the greatest swordsman, and Rheagars BFF, it could make for a damn fun show character

- Aegon 1.  Probably the most obvious pick behind Rhaegar.  The whole conquering of Westeros *should* be the spin off.",SPOILER

"Welcome back to the /r/asoiaf Chapter Review and Discussion series! 

It's been quite a while since the last installment - you can brush up on the archives [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/chapterreviews). For those who haven't read these before: I'm taking a look at the top 10 and bottom 10 chapters in ASOIAF. These OBJECTIVE lists are taken from Tower of the Hand's [chapter rankings](http://i.imgur.com/EYGVk86.png), which were voted on by readers and re-readers alike. 

We've covered 8, 9, and 10 of the best and worst chapters. Today we're jumping to the 7th-best chapter in ASOIAF: **Tyrion VIII, from A Storm of Swords**. 

##Plot Summary

Joffrey marries Margaery. There is a feast. It goes poorly for several people, particularly Joffrey. 

##What's Going On?

THE PURPLE WEDDING!

This chapter is almost definitely on the top 10 list because it contains the death of Joffrey Baratheon. Joffrey sucks. Big time. He's the worst. And to remind us of *why* he's the worst, we open the chapter by identifying Joffrey's ""original sin"" in ASOIAF: sending the catspaw after Bran. 

>He ought to have seen it long ago. Jaime would never send another man to do his killing, and Cersei was too cunning to use a knife that could be traced back to her, but Joff, arrogant vicious stupid little wretch that he was ""¶

I know there is a not-insignificant chunk of the fandom that thinks this isn't the real reveal, that Joffrey couldn't have done it, that it's not satisfying...but this reveal is, in my opinion, perfectly-timed. Joffrey's last chapter on this mortal earth starts with us finally discovering the stupid, reckless, awful, arbitrary thing he did. Other theories about the catspaw culprit fall flat in the face of this all-important context: this is our final reckoning with Joffrey's brand of spiteful idiocy. 

Enough about the catspaw!

The chapter opens with Tyrion thinking about how he has to piss (because he drank too much wine). Wine (and its effects) pops up a lot in this chapter, well before the wine turns purple. Tyrion also, in his internal monologue, lays out a lot of foreshadowing and rationalization for the murder:

>he wanted to strangle his bloody royal nephew

Tyrion sees killing Joffrey as a way to neutralize the lad's insane cruelty. 

>You had best keep your sword well honed, Ser Loras.

Tyrion provides the Tyrells with a rationale for neutralizing Joffrey - avoiding the inevitable bloody conflict. 

>""Would that I'd contrived some mission to take me out of the city. Littlefinger was the clever one.""

Reminding us that Littlefinger is conspicuously absent. 

This chapter serves to start the endgame of ASOS - and by extension, the endgame of the whole War of the Five Kings arc of ASOIAF. We get a paragraph recapping how the war has been petering out - ""who would be mad enough to contest Joffrey's rule now?"" he thinks. With Joffrey's rule cemented, the conflicts that began our story are nearly wrapped up - Ned Stark, Jon Arryn, and Robert Baratheon are now firmly good and buried. Other important characters are either dead or taking on their new forms. Case in point: Lancel Lannister, who emerges at last from long dormancy looking like a damn q-tip: 

>Lancel's hair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick.

We are moving into the next part of the story. 

The wedding and feast are sumptuously described - this is GRRM-Feast at its best. Little details build and crescendo to make this whole complicated affair come to life. It's a lovely bit of writing. 

We also get Tyrion joking with Ser Garlan Tyrell, who is the Absolute Mensch. Garlan is careful to give Tyrion full credit for his deeds at Blackwater Bay. Just when it seems as though things are going swimmingly...the dwarf jesters emerge. It's a grotesque scene, really. It should absolutely remind us of the scenes in Daznak's Pit. This is blood and exploitation for the purpose of base, coarse entertainment, and nothing more. When Tyrion lands a total /r/murderedbywords on Joffrey, Joffrey comes over to spill his wine on Tyrion's head (it is at this point that Ser Garlan says ""That was ill done, Your Grace,"" which makes him, again, an Absolute Mensch). 

The end comes swiftly. Contrasted with the lavish descriptions of neeps and fritters, this farcical hate-play just absolutely clips by. Joffrey embarrassing Tyrion by forcing him to crawl under the tables and chairs is described in short, terse sentences, like a series of slaps to the face. 

From there, it plays out the way we all remember. Joff and Margaery cut the pie; Joff drinks deep from his goblet, and the wine - described as ""red"" before - runs ""purple"" down his chin. He starts coughing. He tears at his throat, just as Cat Tully tore at her face before the end. Tyrion eyes the wine, dumps it out, and is promptly arrested by a very angry mama lion. 

##Character Significance

This chapter is all about Tyrion's need for attention. And it *is* a need. He's missing good familial love, and lashes out in attempts to get people to pay attention to him. When Joff weds Margaery, Tyrion thinks of his own wedding:

>Would it have been so bloody hard to bend those stiff Stark knees of yours and let me keep a little dignity?

It has to be about Tyrion. He offers to take Sansa back to Casterly Rock when the roads are safe again; when this fails to make her happy, he thinks:

>What a pathetic little man you are...When have you ever made a woman smile but with gold?

Come on, Tyrion. It's not about you, buddy. You really think telling Sansa she's never going back to Winterfell and will go live at the Lannister home is somehow going to cheer her up? His relationship to Sansa gets explored here a little bit - he starts to realize just how competent she is at politicking and schmoozing, thinking to himself as she entertains guest after guest: ""She is good at this."" And yet he's incapable of thinking of her as an intelligent person in her own right; when she acts nervous and flighty at dinner, he chalks it up to her being jealous of Margaery (what???). Later, when he asks her if something's wrong, he thinks:

>all her kin are slaughtered and she's wed to me, and I wonder what's amiss.

Well, again, Tyrion: it's nothing to do with you. 

When the singers start playing, Tyrion - here's a shocker - makes it about himself:

>""If I am ever Hand again, the first thing I'll do is hang all the singers,"" said Tyrion, too loudly. 

When Garlan recognizes Tyrion's bravery at Blackwater, Tyrion is ""absurdly grateful."" Someone noticed him! 

And then, of course, Joffrey *does* make it about Tyrion. He brings in the dwarf jousters, and when they are done their joust he declares they should fight Tyrion as well. Tyrion, not one to sit back and take things passively, stands up on the table and delivers a #sick burn to Joffrey: 

> ""I'll ride the pig...but only if you ride the dog!""
> 
> Joff scowled, confused. ""Me? I'm no dwarf. Why me?""
> 
> *Stepped right into the cut, Joff.* ""Why, you're the only man in the hall that I'm certain of defeating!""

And Tyrion fuckin' loves it. He revels in it. He #owned his nephew, a drunk teenager, with a totally rad burn. How cool is that??

Of course, it's this insult that leads to Joff making Tyrion his cupbearer, which in turn leads to him being suspected as the poisoner. Tyrion has to one-up everyone, has to rise to every insult, and that's his undoing in this chapter, his tragic flaw. He even thinks, earlier in the chapter:

>My big mouth will be the death of me, I swear it. 

##Background Bits

* Just so everyone knows, this is when Olenna takes the gem from Sansa's hairrnet:

>'""The wind has been at your hair, though.""ù The little old woman reached up and fussed at the loose strands, tucking them back into place and straightening Sansa's hair net.

* There's a heartbreaking moment near the end of the chapter where Sansa realizes that Ilyn Payne isn't carrying Ice anymore. She clutches Tyrion's arm and says ""What has Ser Ilyn done with my father's sword?"" This Valyrian-Steel-related crime loops us back to the beginning of the chapter where we get the Joff reveal. 

* There's a curious quote at the end of the chapter. 

>...his eyes fell on the wedding chalice, forgotten on the floor. He went and scooped it up. There was still a half-inch of deep purple wine in the bottom of it. Tyrion considered it a moment, then poured it on the floor. 

Some folks have debated what this might mean; it has [been suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiafreread/comments/3tj6o0/spoilers_all_rereaders_discussion_asos_60_tyrion/cx7ets8/) that, simply enough, Tyrion was just thinking of finishing off an empty, so to speak; he wanted more wine. And almost died for it. Oopsies! 

* Of course, the jousting dwarfs (hired by Littlefinger, no less) are Penny and Oppo. Tyrion will meet Penny in ADWD, after Oppo dies when he's mistaken for Tyrion in Feast. Funnily enough, this chapter also has Olenna Tyrell ribbing Tyrion over the ""dwarf's penny,"" Tyrion's tax on whores in King's Landing. Pennies and dwarves!

* Penny and Oppo were hired by Oswell Kettleblack, the father of Osmund, Osfryd, and Osney. Oswell is also the guy who picks up Dontos and Sansa after the wedding. He's clearly a trusted confidant of Littlefinger - what role will he play in the future? 

##Commentary

Again, this is a chapter that got a lot of votes because something Big happens in it - and something big we all wanted to see! It's honestly a quiet chapter outside of Joff's death, though; up until things go horribly wrong, it feels almost like the epilogue to ASOS. Characters are moving into position for the next act, Tyrion is reflecting on what a long, strange trip it's been...part of the shock of Joff's death is that it comes in this otherwise innocuous chapter (again, innocuous *until it's not.*)

"From wherever in the books House Manderly are described to have a dozen petty lords and a hundred landed knights who swear fealty to them. What I wanted to know is that do the houses like hornwood and flints of widows watch owe fealty to them or are they directly vasseled to the Starks? They've been mentioned to have influence in all houses east of the White Knife and I'd assume South of the Boltons. Thats from the Asoiaf wiki. 

We know that Donella Hornwood was a Manderly by birth and is the cousin of Wyman Manderly which is proof that if they arent liege and vassel then they have a strong close relationship likely to counter the Boltons. 

Anyone with any help would be appreciated.

Clarification -  The Hornwoods and Flints of Widows Watch are examples of the houses I'm talking about. Its just do they count as one of the dozen petty lords who owe fealty to the Manderlys or are the dozen petty lords merely unnamed tiny insignificant houses?",SPOILER
"Say in a universe where the marriage between Sansa and Tyrion were to produce children, what would the children be named? 

Custom would say that they'd be named Lannister, but seeing as the children were to be Lord of Winterfell, that might not sit well with the Northern bannermen. 

Could it be considered, out of stability that Sansa's heritage take precedent, and the children be named Stark?

Or perhaps the establishment of a cadet branch? Something like 'Lannstark', so both needs would be fulfilled?


Would love to hear your thoughts.",SPOILER
"During the 5 year gap Lady Stoneheart was going to lead an insurgency in Riverlands while Brienne was wasting her time after dead ends. What about the cliffhanger with Jaime? Was this still supposed to happen after a 5 year gap? Would Brienne somehow return to Jaime after 5 years and convince him to come with her? Or did this cliffhanger happen simply because GRRM needed to send Jaime away from King's Landing so that Cersei can ruin everything?

It is also worth keeping in mind that while writing ASoS, GRRM was not planning to create additional POVs like Cersei or Brienne. They came after the 5 year gap was scrapped. As a result, the POV at King's Landing was going to be Jaime, at least until he gets back on the field to deal with the insurgency.

"In AFFC Samwell IV, Maester Aemon discusses how translations from past events can be corrupted over time. He says:

> What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. 

I was dwelling on that specific line when I was reading some theories on Nissa Nissa. I especially liked LuciferisLightbringers idea that Nisan is meant to be used in this context to talk about the Hebrew month of Passover. 

I started doing some research into that word and found that Nisan is also linked to another Hebrew word for bud, or rebirth (specifically the birth of spring as Nisan is April in the Hebrew calendar). So if we go with the fact that Nissan (or Nisan) is a stand-in for the Hebrew word for rebirth, that leaves us with something like this: Nissan Issa (Instead of Nissa Nissa). Issa is the Arabic translation for Jesus Christ. 

I have no tinfoil theory to present, I just found it interesting that if you change the translation of Nissa Nissa to Nisan Issa, it would point to the rebirth of Jesus Christ, or more generally the rebirth of a Godlike hero.

Not sure if there's anything to it, but I thought it was an interesting corollary and potentially points to the idea that Azor Ahai's ""sword"" was potentially impregnating Nisan Issa so they could bring forth a Godlike hero. Potentially a sign that Rhaegar and Lyanna were, in fact, Azor Ahai and Nissa Nissa come again, and that Jon is Lightbringer.

I know it's silly but one of the main reasons I watched the show was because I thought Jon Snow would end up becoming something like arthas or the lich king from wow. I thought after the night watch betrayed him that the white walkers would resurrect him then Jon would return as a undead commander who wants revenge against the people who wronged him and his family. The way he ended up on the show is disappointing. He became the king of the north which means nothing because his kingdom is in ruin and he became Danys bitch.,SPOILER
"One of the interesting aspects where the show and the books diverge is the way they handle revenge. Take Joffrey's death, for example. We see him mostly through Sansa's eyes as this horribly evil monster responsible for the death of her father and later her mother and brother. Joffrey dying in the Purple Wedding was awesome and great and he totally deserved to die horribly, but it wasn't the triumphant ""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"" kind of revenge. It's not Sansa or Jon or Robb or Catelyn killing Joffrey. It's the Tyrells and Littlefinger. 

Consider how the show and books handle the Freys. The show has Arya massacre the Freys and hell, I cheered as loudly as everyone else. Fuck the Freys. But the books? We see how the unceasing desire for revenge turns Catelyn into the monstrous Lady Stoneheart. The inevitable deaths of the Freys won't be the righteous justice the show portrayed it as, but something darker and sadder. 

Compare that to the death of Ramsay. In the show, Sansa feeds him to his dogs, violent revenge for what he did to her on their wedding night. It's a triumphant scene of karmic justice, one of the most popular scenes of Season 6. And to me, the scene is very much out of character for ASOIAF. GRRM doesn't give us the catharsis of revenge. Even the death of Tywin marks a dark turn for Tyrion.
I bet the Boltons fall not to the Starks, but to Stannis instead. Just like it wasn't the Starks who killed Joffrey, but the Tyrells instead. If the Starks do return to Winterfell, I doubt it will be the heroic return we saw in the show.

I just think that's interesting, looking at how the two versions approach vengeance thematically. The show is more willing than the books to let us have bloody revenge on the villains, while the books has us just hope that the characters we love survive without turning into the villains in the process.

The one sticking point is Dany and the Dothraki. Dany takes control of all the Dothraki by burning the Khals, and the show portrays it as a triumph for Dany. I have no doubt that the books will show this slaughter as the start of Dany's dark turn, but how do you make us feel bad that Dany burns the Dothraki? They're so poorly fleshed out and mono-dimensional, just stereotypes of the Mongols. At least the Freys will have innocent women and children, people like Genna Lannister, to show the horror of Lady Stoneheart's vengeance. How will Gurm make us feel bad for the Dothraki?",SPOILER
"How does it benefit euron to have falia naked when she is tied to the ship. It doesn't do anything except possibly tempt the men tying her up to rape her which might screw it up.

So why was her tongue removed first?",SPOILER

"So here is a simple thought we've all had, followed by a end-game prediction:

What if a particular northman named Snow in the show is an amalgamation of the book storylines of Jon and fAegon?  

Side Note: I am not a huge fan of R+L=J simply because Jon and Ned are much more compelling characters if Jon IS the illegitimate son of a man that found love and was imperfect.  I side with those who see it as a misdirect away from R+L=D or something similar. 

&#x200B;

1) The show has decided not to include the fAegon storyline.  They have also chosen to make some questionable calls like renaming a particular northman Aegon. If you accept R+L=J, then it would make more sense for that particular boy to be named Jaehaerys or Aemon.   

* 3-heads had the dragon: Aegon I + Rhaenys + Visenya.    Rhaegar's children:  Aegon + Rhaenys + BOY?
* Aegon I was followed by Aenys/Maegor, neither of which are well regarded in our stories. The next well-regarded king in the family line-up is Jaeharys. Also there is a wink of honoring Lyana's wishes from Ned in the renaming.
* Jaeharys was nicknamed the Conciliator for his ability to negotiate peace. Parallels with Jon / Wildlings. Foreshadows the need for a conciliator at the end of the story.
* Aemon is a recurring name in the family tree given to brothers that do not become kings. Aemon the dragonknight, Aemon one-eye, Aemon the maester.  

&#x200B;

2) The pairing of Jon and Dany doesn't set up for any kind of Dance of the Dragons 2.0.  The pairing with fAegon does!

* fAegon and Dany already have the inheritance motivation. Each believe that it is their right to be monarch over other people. 
* The secret and rightful king ending to the story is too Arthurian (cliche) and it doesn't fit with the themes of the book (feudalism isn't portrayed as being just or particularly good for anyone ... see Preston Jacob's arguments). Do we need a third, secret and rightful king?
* Consider what the role of Jon's character is if he is not the ""rightful king""?  Perhaps he stays dead, or perhaps he comes back, but must continue to piece together a coalition of one-time enemies to fight the dead.
   * The dance of the dragons ended in the ""hour of the wolf.""  The original title of the last book ""A Dream of Spring"" was ""A Time for Wolves.""  It sounds very similar and is quite foreboding. I imagine it is meant to reflect the desolation of that final war and perhaps the resurgence of the Starks.
   * The important part of the ""hour of the wolf"" here is that Cregan Stark took care of business and got out of town.  He didn't take permanent control. Similarly, I expect the heroes of the story to come together and then withdraw.
* Let's assume Dance 2.0 happens before the invasion of the dead in the books and make some educated guesses while drawing parallels to the recent history in ASOIAF. 

&#x200B;

Plot points from early books contrasted against Targaryan kings we are introduced to early on:

Aegon IV (The Unworthy)  > Robert Baratheon                   (who else is famous for having illegitimate kids?)

Daeron II (The Good) v. Daemon I > Blackfyre Rebellion 1.0 > Renly's summer knights v. Joffrey the bastard

Aerys I > Whitewalls (Thwarted Blackfyre Rebellion 2.0)        > Viserys (the Beggar king) + Dothraki fail

Maekar I (The Anvil / Kinslayer) > Blackfyre Rebellion 3.0      > Shadow of Stannis kills Renly (unintentional but guilty?) 

Aegon V (The Unlikely) > War of the Nine-penny Kings (Blackfyre Rebellion 4.0) > War of the five kings

Jaeharys II > Married his sister against his father's wishes, ending in rebellion  > We learn of Cersei / Jamie's twincest from Jaimie's perspective

Aerys II (The Mad) >  Cersei's regency / learning from her own POV that she might be a bit crazy.  She will likely be the end of her line as monarchs.

&#x200B;

LIKELY plot points of future books (with order of ""middle kings"" reversed):

Viserys II > Raised in Essos  > Dany's learning to reign in Mereen

Baelor I (The Blessed) >    High sparrow manipulating Tommen (books + show)

Daeron I (Young Dragon) > fAegon's invasion from the south (end of last book)

Aegon III (Dragonbane)       >   Theft / Death of dragons:

* Possibly Rhaegal WAS stolen by Quentyn and will be given to fAegon?  
* Victarion/Euron steal Viserion? 
* in the book history, Alysane's dragon wouldn't pass the wall
* fAegon may learn what the ""f"" stand for (Blackfyre Rebellion 5.0 ... who else are the bane of the Targaryans?)

 Aegon II (The Usurper) v. Rhaenyra (the Realm's delight) > Dance of the Dragons 1.0 >   Dany v. fAegon  in Dance 2.0

\---->   Destruction of kings landing in the fighting

&#x200B;

Dance 2.0 breaks the realm into many separate and warring kingdoms. Similar, but not identical to its state pre-conquest.  Could the end game parallel the early kings?

Aegon I (The Conqueror)                    >      fAegon in the crown lands and storm lands

COMPLETE GUESS AT END-GAME

So finally, ""The hour of the Wolf""         >             A Time for Wolves (aka A Dream of Spring)

The ending of the series will be encompassed by the 2nd ""hour of the wolf"" at the end of Dance 2.0.  

* Dany and fAegon negotiate a peace together enforced by Jon after their armies destroy each other and the northerners retreat en masse south.   (Perhaps R+L=D and then GRRM writes more Targaryan incest with fAegon.)
* Dany dies paralleling Rhaenyra in Dance 1.0.  Remaining dragons die.
* Jon finds a way to negotiate a new peace with the white walkers.  Perhaps they voluntarily withdraw after the death of the last dragon and greenseer (they diminish into the north due to the death of magic in the world? ala Elves in tLotR).
* fAegon may take the iron thrown, but it no longer means anything. 

====================

TLDR; the show version of Jon Snow includes some strange southern storylines that fit more in line with fAegon's projected book story than Jon's projected book story in my opinion.  The parts that get hard to enjoy in the show might be due to the difficulty of melding their storylines.  ",SPOILER
"The HBO decision to make a series about the Long Night is one of the latest examples of a decades long trend. TV networks, and before them, Hollywood studios, have a record of trying to milk trends that are on their way out, or making zombies of the recently deceased. The Walking Dead is on its last legs, and many viewers got bored and switched off years ago. When I was 18 public appetite for zombies was running high, but now even Call of Duty players have gone off them. The Wights were never what made us want to read the next book. They're one of Martin's laziest creations: basic zombies plus stealing linguistic application from Tolkien. They're such a let-down in the context of the Others, that even Waymar Royce's resurrection is comparatively dull. Despite this, HBO reckons that this is the way to go, and their folly may kill off ASOIAF on-screen. It makes sense that the Dance of the Dragons would seem too expensive, or the Tales of Dunk and Egg too light. But it wouldn't have been difficult to write something a bit more interesting than a medieval zombie apocalypse. ",SPOILER
"Hi everyone,

So, i was just watching some videos about all the awesome theories about the upcoming season and the importance of the Winterfell crypts. And as i was reading the part where they say they keep the Starks with iron swords on their laps to keep the Vengeful Spirits within, it occurred to me we never saw a Stark becoming an actual white walker... The only Stark we actually think became a white walker has a mind of its own (or devoted to the 3 eyed raven, but still, not under the control of the Night King).

So what if the Starks, by sharing the blood of the first man, and maybe the blood of the first Night King, can actually become undeads like cold hands? What if the crypt is actually a room to store the dozens of Starks to fight for the Realm if the Metaphoric Winter (The long night from the Night King) ever reaches Winterfell?Of course i don't have as much knowledge as all the scholars from the community, but i see that as a possibility, specially because i never understood the character of cold hands and that would give him some sort of explanation.

Would love to hear the opinion of more knowledgeable people about this.

If the theory about euron using aeron to warg krakens is correct why does he think aeron will use the krakens for him and not against him.
Why does falia flowers need to be naked on the ship. If euron wants to use her to incite lust to distract the redwyne fleets men that makes no sense because the redwynes don't follow the old way. In fact, this is more likely to affect his men. (Who follow the old way) than the enemies men. If it is to show what happens to those who oppose euron than why remove her tongue. If she can talk than euron could promise her that if she talks about how this is what happens to those who oppose euron he would set her free to be a princess again. Than she would be a propaganda source for euron. And why does she need to be naked as opposed to clothed and therefore less likely to distract his men? Looking for answers about this ",SPOILER

"What if there exists within the Citadel itself a secret society of maesters that none of the other maesters know about or will openly acknowledge.  I say they do exist and every maester unknowingly undertakes the initiation ritual but only a few are selected.  So that just leaves the ritual and how they are recruited for the cause.

If you can light a glass candle then you are approached and recruited to be a member of their society.  You then spend your time in pursuits of the higher mysteries.  The maesters, not in the secret society, were the ones who rid the world of dragons but in the process severed some ties to a source of the power and/or abilities of the secret society.  Three within the books leap to mind Marwyn, Qyburn and possibly Aemon.  I would also consider people like Melisandre, Thoros of Myr, Benerro, Moqorro, Ezzelyno and  Quaithe members of a similar type society although not directly connected to the Citadel.

But what will happen to him in the next books ? Will he live long enough to hear about Daenerys finally travelling and arriving in Westeros ? Will he outlive his former protegee ? Will he be confronted by her for his possible attempts to manipulate her and for championning in secret another dragon pretender ?",SPOILER
"I've been rereading Fire and Blood and TWOIAF, and there's quite a few times where I can't help but feel something important is happening just below the surface, not directly known to the readers. And I was wondering if anyone ever felt the same, particularly about Targaryen history? I'll give you a few examples of some moments that stick out to me personally.

* Take Aegon's Landing itself. It happens on the same day that Harrenhal is completed, Harren the Black is painted as an almost demonic figure, and is the first foe that Aegon destroys. Harrenhal is partially made of weirwoods and it resembles fused black stone after Balerion melts it. This also headed off a conflict between the King of the Iron Islands and the Storm King, evocative of two mythical feuds: between the Drowned god and Storm god, and Sea god and Storm King. 
* Speaking of Harrenhal, let's talk about the Battle Above the Gods Eye. Daemon waits there for 13 days, and carves 13 marks Harrenhal's weirwood tree to count the days. Aemond shows up with a pregnant sorceress and Visenya's dragon Vhagar. Daemon wields Visenya's sword Dark Sister, and shoves the Valyrian steel sword through the sapphire that Aemond keeps in his empty eye, the eye he lost the day he tamed Vhagar. 
* While we're on the subject of Dark Sister and Daemon, we might as well mention King Maegor. The similarities beween Daemon and Maegor are insane. Both wielded Dark Sister. Both were second sons and the younger brother of the King. Both married their niece. Both had multiple wives. Both had twin daughters, through either blood or marriage. Both had reputed sorceresses for paramours. Both fought a war in the Stepstones. Both had the title of Prince of Dragonstone taken from them. Both fought a war primarily against Oldtown. Both retook King's Landing from dragonback. Both were exiled to Pentos. Both killed their nephew, from dragon back, above the God's Eye.
* Everything about Bloodraven's story suggests something more is going on. He's stabbed in the eye with Valyrian steel like Aemond, although he lives. He's a greenseer, so he's literally privy to some secret information that we aren't aware of. It seems like he may have planned to go to the Wall, considering he worked to place Egg on the Throne and then Egg immediately sent him to the Wall. 
* And no discussion of Aegon V would be complete without Summerhall. It sounds like Aegon thought he know how hatch dragons. The intensity of the fire sounds like something at least a little supernatural was happening. Quite a few important people were essentially sacrificed to the fires, and out of it all comes Rhaegar, as if born from the flames of a royal funeral pyre. 

And that's just a few of the things in Targaryen history, the ones that I can summarize quickly. There's also some things in more ancient history. There's various Westerosi myths that might be said to have elements of the Blood Betrayal. The story of the Grey King, having stolen the fire of the gods, is sort of like the Bloodstone Emperor worshipping a star from the heavens; both Prometheus-like moments. The broad strokes of the story of Durran Godsgrief are similar to the Blood Betrayal; he angers a god by stealing the power of a divine female. The legend of Maris the Maid shares some similar themes as the story of Elenei; a possibly divine female, the daughter of Garth Greenhand, marries someone she isn't supposed to and angers Argoth Stone-Skin. Other people have interpreted the story of Elenei as sexualized version of the story of Nissa Nissa (or visa versa: the story of Lightbringer as a metaphor for the sexual story of Elenei). The legend of Ser Galladon is even more like the story of Azor Ahai and Nissa Nissa; the Maiden ""loses her heart"" to him and in return he's given a magical sword. 

This is just one specific set of similarities. There are plenty of others that have little or nothing to do with the Blood Betrayal. The Weeping Lady of Lys and myth of Alyssa Arryn, for example. Or the similarities between the myths of the Three Sisters and the story of Elenei. 

I'm in no way trying to explain what these similarities mean, and they could very well mean nothing; I have no idea what the similarities between Daemon and Maegor mean, for example, if they mean anything at all. That's actually my point: the reader is constantly given the impression that things we don't understand are going on just beneath the surface of the text, but no theory has ever been put forward that convincingly explains the complex web of similarities between ancient myths, or the oddities that occur during the reign of House Targaryen.

So my question for each of you is two-fold:

1. Is there any significance to the various ancient myths, and the similarities between them? Is there a specific picture that GRRM is hinting at, with various myths just individual pieces we could use to see the larger picture? A picture which might then be useful in understanding the second Long Night? **Or,** are all of these myths just ""world building""; GRRM cleverly putting different twists on similar concepts so as to make it appear as though there are similarities, without there being any definitive answer that the reader could figure out?
2. Is there any significance to the odd moments in Targaryen history, like the similarities between Maegor and Daemon, or the Tragedy of Summerhall? Were the Targaryen's privy to some supernatural knowledge from Valyria that influenced their actions? Is there something divine, or at least special in some way, about the Targaryens themselves, at least as it relates to ""the blood of the dragon""? **Or,** do all of these strange events serve a purpose similar to world building; has GRRM purposely and carefully created an air of mystery that makes it seem like there's something happening in secret, when really there's nothing there for the reader to puzzle out?

What are your personal beliefs on the subject? Are there answers? Or has GRRM just made it seem as if there is by creating stories that follow the same broad strokes, and drawing our attention to events that don't actually have any further significance? 

**TL;DR:** Gurm make mystery. Gurm make answer?",SPOILER

"I'm just throwing these unorganized thoughts out there to see what you guys think about them.

So do Starks become Others (not wights) if their bodies are not sealed with an iron sword? Iron is repellant for the Others, Starks are rumoured to have Others' blood and their bodies are sealed in the crypts.

 Ned's brother and father were burned, which is also one of the ways that Others are killed, and later their remains were sealed in the crypts. But Ned's body is missing, maybe he'll come back as the Other? Or maybe the Stark that had his sword taken by Bran in the crypts will eventually wake up when the winter comes. 

Remember, in the books Others are a race with their own language and tools, not just ice zombies. The wights are the dead under their command. There's no Nights King in the present, at least not yet. Maybe one of the Starks will end up being their head.

Also according to Wikipedia ""A wight is a creature or living sentient being. In its original usage the word wight described a living human being, but more recently, the word has been used within the fantasy genre of literature to describe certain undead.""

"Overview

The year is 233 AC. Maekar I Targaryen, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm died during the Peake Uprising. A great council was called by the dead king's uncle, Brynden Rivers, the Hand of the King, to choose a new king. Aenys Blackfyre, a son of Daemon Blackfyre heard about the council and realized that he could take the Iron Throne with words rather than sword, as his father and older brothers failed to do. In King's Landing, the Hand received his nephew Aenys' letter asking for safe passage to the capital in order to participate in the great council. Bloodraven accepted but when Aenys arrived in Westeros, he was captured and killed by Bloodraven, who became a kinslayer once again. Aenys' head was brought by Bloodraven before the great council to show the lords of the realm what happens with Blackfyre scum who dare to claim the Iron Throne. The council got the message and eventually and reluctantly chose Aegon Targaryen, or Egg, as king. The first thing Aegon V did as king? He arrested his granduncle and Hand for perfidy. 

The Plot...

Now, Aegon V didn't have much love for Bloodraven, as Egg was Maekar's son who openly distrusted his uncle. However, no matter how much Maekar hated Bloodraven, he kept him as Hand because he was incredibly efficient and he was a Blackfyre killing machine. If a Blackfyre appeared somewhere in the world and did as little as say ""I'm king"", Bloodraven would do anything to get that man and kill him. Despite Brynden's advanced age in 233 (58 years), he was still an extremely powerful political figure and a highly influential courtier as well as a great administrator. Aegon, as his father, didn't like Bloodraven but still respected the hell out of him. Yes, Brynden committed perfidy and broke the word of the Iron Throne but the murdered man was a Blackfyre. You know, the House that tried to oust the Targaryens for 38 years. Aegon could have said: ""Yes, Aenys Blackfyre was killed under a peace banner but he was a traitor in open rebellion to the Iron Throne and the Iron Throne gives no quarter to traitors."" and no one would have given a shit (many would actually be relieved that a new Blackfyre Rebellion was averted). But what did Aegon do? He sentenced Brynden to death with the option of going to the Wall. He ousted his most powerful ally, a man who gave everything for his family and his king, no matter who that king was. You would find no man more loyal to House Targaryen than Brynden Rivers. Removing such a man from court was a stupid move, despite what he did. Brynden presumably died in 252 at age 77 but we know better (wink, wink). Let's say, for the sake of argument that he remained in King's Landing. Aegon V lost 19 years of Bloodraven's council and influence (provided that he died in 252). If Brynden Rivers was Hand during Aegon V's reign, do you think he would have permitted Aegon's children to marry for love? No! He would have strong-armed them into marrying the people who were chosen for them for the political value that this would bring to House Targaryen. And many bloodshed would have been averted. Now, what's Aemon's part in this mess? Aemon Targaryen, the older brother of Aegon V, was a maester of the Citadel, a man chained and sworn to serve the realm. He was of a bookish disposition and was very intelligent, thus presumably he got along well with Bloodraven, a fellow intellectual. At Citadel, Aemon probably did extremely well and, due to his intellect, he probably pieced together the threat of the Others. His fellow maesters didn't like Aemon due to his Targaryen blood and such, he never became Archmaester, but I don't think Aemon leaned in that direction. He was a servant of the people and if he discovered that the Others would eventually return, the other maesters wouldn't believe him. But who would believe him? Bloodraven, of course. A magic practitioner, Brynden Rivers was not a stranger to esoteric ideas so if Aemon had any concerns in this field, he would share them with his granduncle. Now, Aemon and Brynden realized that if the Others return, the Wall would be the first place in the, let's call it, civilized Westeros that they would strike. They needed to go there. But King Maekar wouldn't let them take the black (Brynden was Hand and Aemon served at Dragonstone). Now, with Maekar's death and the information that Aenys wants to parlay, well, the pieces fit perfectly. So Aemon proposed this crazy plan to Bloodraven: ""You get rid of Aenys Blackfyre, another contender to our dear Egg's reign and I make sure we go to the Wall after that. Of course, granduncle, your honor will be turned to shit but anyway, being known as a kinslaying bastard warlock for like 30 years, your honor is already shit so no harm there."" Of course, Brynden did what he did best, fucking Blackfyre's plans and Aemon, being the good and honorable brother he was, probably influenced Aegon V's decision to exile Bloodraven. Then, Aemon said to his brother ""Well, if Bloodraven joined the NW, well, I kinda want to join to, you know? To get rid of me as an obstacle to your reign, etc."". Aegon relented and the two Targaryens went to the Wall. There, Bloodraven was eventually elected Lord Commander with his grandnephew as his right hand and maester.

TL, DR: Aemon and Bloodraven schemed together to go to the Wall, rule Castle Black from positions of power in order to find a solution to the Others' problem. It's a long post, I know. What do you think?",SPOILER
"Hi guys, I think I've broken big on a new theory that I have yet see be talked about anywhere. It struck me as obvious on my recent rewatch, so without further ado here it is:

In season 7, Sam spends most of his time at the citadel. Most of his time there is devoted to various busywork and particularly, cleaning. He cleans many things shown to us in a montage, particularly, he cleans poop. Yes, that's right, it's poop. Most of this montage is devoted to cleaning poop. Now, us as the viewers have no clue as to whose poop Sam is cleaning, or why? To answer this question we have to go back, before the events of the series. To Robert's Rebellion.

Rhaegar Targaryen. He's a mysterious figure in the series, there's no doubt. We are told he was killed at the Battle of the Trident, that Robert Baratheon killed him in single combat. We're told from other sources outside the show that Rhaegar's breastplate was studded with rubies. Where else do we see a ruby prominently in the series? Ah yes, Melisandre's glamor necklace which disguises her as young and attractive when she's really an old hag.

Let's say Rhaegar was using this magic. Being the prince of the Iron Throne, he may have had means to obtain something like this. Rhaegar sent someone else in his stead, who died as him in the battle. We never see a flashback of Rhaegar's death, only his marriage with Lyanna. It's commonly said in this series that no one really dies unless you see it happen on screen (See: The Hound), and even then, they could still come back (Jon). So about Rhaegar's personality? We know he sings, plays the harp, he's solemn and brooding. He's studious. He knows about prophecies and we can assume he spends some time readings. We also know from Barristan's story that he likes to pretend that he's not Rhaegar... but a street player... What group of people do we know of that forfeit their names and titles, that spend their time reading and learning? That's right the maesters.

So Rhaegar ""died"" at the trident, and fled to the Citadel to become a maester. But the maesters are smart (they read books), they would know a Targaryen when they saw one. They send Aemon to the Wall, to keep him from working in favor of his own house, ensuring he forfeits his bloodline indefinitely in the most apolitical place in Westeros. They would know Rhaegar. It's ambiguous how much the maesters know, or what's in their little forbidden books section, as Sam so desperately wants to know, yet they prevent him from gaining access too, seemingly laughing off his pleas about the White Walkers. What if the maesters knew about the White Walkers though?

So, Rhaegar is at the Citadel, but what is he doing? Let's say the maesters know about dragonglass in their spooky books section. Maybe they knew how to make it? But how? Targaryens have the blood of Old Valyria, a a magical bloodline of dragonriders and prophecy rearing and other spooky shit. What if the maesters decided, with the throne usurped, they'd perform some experiments on Rhaegar, who is believed to be dead. Maybe this is where Qyburn got kicked out or something? It's like poetry. It rhymes. To ensure he doesn't die, maybe they have him breed to make more of those with Targaryen blood, to continue their experiments, too. Who knows? It's possible.

Now, Sam comes along, years later. From the Night's Watch, talking about White Walkers and the army of the dead. They know Sam can be of good use to them, but they can't show their hand just yet unless they trust him of course. So they send him off doing all manners of novice duty. Particularly, Sam is emptying chamber pots. A lot of them. Tons and tons of poop. They have a room that's just full of shitting people. After that, Sam is shown taking poop to a specific room INSIDE THE CITADEL, not outside, not in an outhouse, not to the water, no. They keep the poop inside. I'm serious. 40 seconds in (https://youtu.be/9l93iKOGPys). But before that, take a look 37 seconds in. There's an old man that Sam is collecting poop from. Take a careful look at this scene. There's a hole cut out in the bottom of his bed just for poop. I mean, look at the guys face. He's been lying there shitting for the maesters for years, no doubt. It's a pained, and regretful face, emotion conveyed beautifully. It's s o obvious it's unbelievable. Have you guessed it already? That man, that Sam collects poop from... that's Rhaegar Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The maesters, have been gathering his poop. The others in that poop room? His direct descendants. All his children. Their poop is taken directly to a special holding chamber inside the Citadel.

Why though? Why on earth would the maesters confine a bunch of Targs including Rhaegar himself to a chamber in the citadel, shitting their lives away? Well it's simple. Obvious in fact. DRAGONGLASS IS PETRIFIED TARGARYEN POOP. THE MAESTERS KNOW ABOUT THE WHITE WALKERS. THEY'RE STOCKPILING DRAGONGLASS TO PREPARE FOR THE LONG NIGHT 2.0. THEY'RE GOING TO ARM JON AND DANY WITH DRAGONGLASS TO FIGHT THE NIGHT KING. JON WILL BE REUNITED WITH HIS REAL FATHER. If you don't believe this, think about Dragonstone... an island of dragonglass. The Targs lived on Dragonstone... it's made of their poop. The Valyrian Roads? Poop. It's all poop. The key to killing the Night King? Jon's poop.",SPOILER

I'm thinking Victarion is a definite maybe, he can strangle people pretty easily and butchers them consistently, although Jaime presumably would have had some idea of Victarion's prowess after the Greyjoy rebellion.

Strong Belwas seems pretty strong, not sure if we ever really see the extant of that.

I'm thinking Shagga son of Dolf, while not a Lord probably has a diverse hunter-gatherer diet that keeps him in good health, and his size is often attested too.

"I realized this a few days ago. Might be absolutely wrong but after reading Fire and Blood and resparking my interest it makes sense. 

The Targaryens and other Valyrians marry brother to sister to keep the blood in the family *because* if they don't and dilute the ""blood of the dragon"" too much they wouldn't be able to bond with dragons and thus lose their major base of power. 

The Red Sowing showed this aplenty. Odds are some of those who died were dragon seed but just too far back and not enough. That idiot Quentyn thought because he had dragon blood. He didn't have enough of it.

"I just wanted to throw this out there and ask if you all think this may have been the source of inspiration for the lightbringer prophecy. Below will be the Jainism text and the the lightbringer prophecy.

Dhoramnath Shrine Lore: Travelling to the north he began to climb the highest hill he could see, but it became Nanao, ""weighed down"", by his sin. He chose another hill, but for it too the burden of guilt was too great and it became Jhurio, ""broken down"". He chose a third hill, and climbing it backwards it bore him, and he called it Dhinodhar, ""the patience bearer""

Lightbringer: He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.

The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.

The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes

What do you think? Not sure if this was brought up before.",SPOILER

"I'm rereading the series and just noticed this passage in AGoT Arya III. This is the chapter she finds herself in the room in the Red Keep where the dragon skulls are kept:

""If the room with the monsters had been dark, the hall was the blackest pit in the seven hells. *Calm as still water,* Arya told herself, but even when she gave her eyes a moment to adjust, there was nothing to see but the vague grey outline of the door she had come through. She wiggled her fingers in front of her face, felt the air move, saw nothing. **She was blind.** *A water dancer sees with all her senses,* she reminded herself...""

Oberyn Martell talks about how according to Dornish law Mycella would be Joffrey's heir and how Doran may decide to crown Mycella so that Trystan would be her king. (I have no current recollection of how the Dorne plot goes in ADWD so I'll be excited to get there again because it will be like a first time experience again lol). What I find interesting about this is Aegon is the obvious candidate for Dorne to support due to his mother, but by their own law they would recognize Daenerys's claim first as Rhaegar was never king and Daenerys would have been the heir after Viscerys. Now maybe Dorne would recognize grandson over 2nd son/daughter in a case like this. I just think it's a kinda fun example of the ways all the players twist their own rules for their benefit. They will push it too their benefit, then ignore it to their own benefit as well.",SPOILER
"According to [Ran](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/148863-the-book-of-swords-the-sons-of-the-dragon-spoilers/&do=findComment&comment=8229237), there was a Targaryen family tree dating circa 1998 in which Alysanne was the daughter of Maegor. Then GRRM changed the family tree and Alysanne became daughter of Aenys and sister of Jaehaerys.

> **A Game of Thrones - Daenerys IX**

> ""And I am Daenerys Stormborn, Daenerys of House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and **Maegor the Cruel** and old Valyria before them. I am the dragon's daughter, and I swear to you, these men will die screaming. Now bring me to Khal Drogo.""

As a result, in the quote above, Dany meant that she was a direct descendant of Maegor and it was true at that time. This also has ramifications on the deformity of Rhaego. Before this retcon, Rhaego's deformity was a unique case, implied to be caused by MMD's magic. But later, GRRM created lots of deformed Targaryen babies and MMD's part in the condition of Rhaego is now dubious. It is also impossible to not notice that GRRM is making the childbirth way more dangerous to the mothers (even more so with Targaryen babies) than it was in the real world in the corresponding medieval times.",SPOILER
"After reading through F&B and seeing the actions of some Kingsguard a thought game to my mind. Could Jaime have saved Aegon, Rhaenys, and Elia during the sack? I'm not asking whether he could have killed the Mountain but whether he could have gotten there and stopped it. 
The reasons for me asking this question 
1.) F&B had me thinking a lot about succession and regencies. I remember somewhere that Jaime was asked who to name as king and he said whoever you want. 
2.) The whole dance and the '""secret siege""ù have me wondering the distance between Maegor's Holdfast and the Red Keep. 

So hear are the questions I'd like to see discussed 
1.) If Jaime hasn't '""gone away inside""ù and sat on the Iron Throne, is there a non-zero chance that he could have arrived at the Holdfast in time to save them. 
2.) Assuming Lorch and the Mountain aren't dumb enough to try to kill their liegelord's favorite son how would Jaime react to the news of his father ordering the deaths of the royal family. 
3.) Would Robert, Jon, and Ned accept a regency for Aegon VI versus the alternatives 
4.) If Aegon or Rhaenys, or both, lived what alternatives would there have been to a regency? 
5.) If Ned came to the Tower of Joy as a '""Regent for Aegon VI""ù or similar position, does the Tower of Joy fight still happen?
6.) If R+L=J how does that play out?

"I had a realization with regards to the sigil of House Tarth whilst rereading AGOT. When talking to Arya about her and Sansa, Ned says this:

>You may be as different as **the sun and the moon**, but the same blood flows through both your hearts.  
>  
>\- AGoT, Arya II

The sigil of House Tarth is described like this:

>The arms of Tarth were quartered rose and azure, and bore **a yellow sun and crescent moon**.  
>  
>\- AFFC, Brienne II

Brienne of Tarth's story is very connected to the Stark girls. In ASOS, Brienne of Tarth is charged with bringing Jaime Lannister to King's Landing by Catelyn Stark to make a hostage exchange for Sansa and Arya Stark. Later in AFFC, Brienne is on a quest to find Sansa Stark at the behest of Jaime Lannister and to uphold her vow to Catelyn Stark.

Brienne also shares some similarities to the Stark girls. Like Arya, Brienne does not fit the traditional mold of what a woman should be in the eyes of a patriarchal society like Westeros. Similarly to Sansa, Brienne is an idealistic young woman who held songs and the tales of true knights close to her heart.

"Given, in this world, being a servant would always suck. 

The pay.. '""It ain't much, but it's honest work""ù. 

The problem is when there is a conflict. A simple servant or guard has no power over these changes. Most times they are not even educated enough to understand inheritance laws. 

When an usurper rises and takes the castle, they may decide to put all of the servants to the sword simply for serving a false ruler. If they are kept alive, they have no choice but to serve under the usurper. More often than not running away would mean their death (and why would they run? Their house/family is there). But if then the usurper is put down, and the previous ruler returns (or their descenders), they are at risk again of being killed for serving an usurper.   

These people, who do nothing but serve, are pretty much screwed either way. I'm not surprised that Kings Landing is filled with '""little birds""ù whispering around. Which servant would truly be loyal to these rulers? ",SPOILER
"It could be based around any event, or just a set time so all the details of the books would be new. What time period, or event would you want the series to be about, and why? What important characters or events would you want to have portrayed?


I would want a series based around the history of the Valyrian empire and Westeros in the years leading up to the Doom of Valyria, and the century of blood. It could be a series covering, maybe, 100 years before the doom, then the century of blood in Westeros through Aegons conquest. It can be written in the style of a maester, but be very detailed with major characters and events be included. This would be very good to be able to get a lot of detail of how the houses in Westeros were before Aegons conquest when there were 7 kings, and I would love to have detail on how Valyria was before the doom. I think it would be awesome to see how Valyria would be. Or it could be written like a Asoiaf, from different character POVs and instead take place over 5-10 years before the doom and a few years after. This would be an excellent way to get to know what life was really like in The Valyrian empire.


A close 2nd would be The Age Of Heroes. I would want it to be done in A true high fantasy fiction, have it full of all of the magic and mythical characters. It would be awesome to see the building of the wall. It would be set from different character POVs, but not the major mythical characters so as not to ruin the magical aura. It would take place over the last few years of the the war between the CotF and the first men, and the end of the long night. It would answer a lot of questions of the forging of the pact, and the true origin of white walkers, and Azor Ahai. I would want it as magical and fantastic as possible it would be amazing.

"Hey guys, I just finished reading the Iron Islands chapter in the World of Ice and Fire book where they talk about Nagga the great Sea Dragon that fed on whales, large ships and even krakens.  Some Iron Born even believe that the giant bones that are on the shores of Old Wyk are Nagga's bones, but could very easily be the bones of a large whale.  It just got me thinking that what if Sea Dragons do exist? Someone on here posted that really cool artwork done of that Ice Dragon, even though it's not cannon, it was still really cool and made me think that they could possibly exist.

So getting to Euron's blood sacrifice, what if he's actually trying raise a Sea Dragon.  Dragons are constantly mentioned with blood, and even blood magic has been referenced in order for them be to hatched in the first place. House Targaryen's words are 'Fire and Blood' and they are the keepers of dragons. Euron even conveniently ""threw a dragon egg into the sea"" when they are some of the most valuable items in the world. For a man who loves loot and treasure this seems very out of character. Don't forget about that dragon binder horn either. Maybe that horn really does control dragons, but instead of Dany's its the ones under the sea.

I'm just spit ballin' here but it would be pretty badass if the massive blood sacrifice he's committing outside of Oldtown will either raise a Sea Dragon from the depths or hatch a Sea Dragon from that egg he threw in the ocean.",SPOILER
"There has been a lot of ~~libel~~ discussions regarding the caliber of Ser Barristan Selmy. By Dance, we get to actually go inside his head and follow his reasoning. Yet there are those in this order daring to befoul our Lord Commander of the Queensguard's good name. Barristan is a True Knight, who like so many in the world has to reconcile his decisions with his numerous oaths (to his gods), vows (to his leaders), and honor (to his self). By his own admission, Barristan was made to be a knight and follow orders. Even so, Barristan will go to great lengths to do what is right even when adhering to all his loyalties.

Barristan is a knight who swore holy oaths.

>""in the name of the Warrior I charge you to be brave."" ""In the name of the Father I charge you to be just."" ""In the name of the Mother I charge you to defend the young and innocent."" ""In the name of the Maid I charge you to protect all women."" - Lyonel Baratheon, The Hedge Knight

Barristan is a member of the Kingsguard who made solemn vows.

>""Defend the king. Obey the king. Keep his secrets. Do his bidding. Your life for his."" - Jaime, ACOK Catelyn VII

Barristan learned from great men what personal honor meant. He was nighted by King Aegon V, Egg! Raised to the Kingsguard by the esteemed White Bull, fought in tourneys against Ser Duncan the Tall and Duncan the Prince of Dragonflies since he was freaking 10. Barristan grew up in ~~the~~ a golden age of knighthood. There were evil invaders to destroy (Maelys the Monstrous), the smallfolk were getting a modicum of respect (King Egg), and with The Tragedy at Summerhall, Barristan came riding into the the kingsguard as hero with a purpose. The world was Black and White, and our hero was literally draped in white. Then the story gets interesting.

King Arthur created the Knights of the Round Table as a diversion for men who were fit for naught but fighting. The quests, honor, conquests, etc., where designed to keep the knights fighting for clearly-defined and just causes (let's not discuss the crusades prettyprettyplease), because these men were warriors, not philosophers. Barristan is the rare creature who is both. He follows orders and is the consummate professional, but always tries to be better. After the Defiance of Duskendale, Barristan saved the life of an innocent child. Barristan disagrees with Bobbie B about sending assassins for Daenarys. Barristan never threatens Dany's Hostages when working with the Shavepate.  Even when fighting Khrazz, Barristan extends courtesy, and offers he opponent numerous times to yield. Every time Barristan takes the high road, even though it lessens his esteem in the eyes of his peers and leaders. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I present you an honorable man!

Regarding serving Aerys the Insane. Barristan could not go against Aerys when he was being evil, so long as it was contained. Buring Hands of the king could be justified (the Mannis does this). Barristan is certainly aware of all the sins Aerys committed and even reflects on his failings to do anything. In reality, he couldn't do anything, and it is defensible to say for the sake of the realm, he shouldn't do anything. Off-canon, but in the show Jaime tells Eddard about his father and brother dying, how 500 people watched and did nothing. Barristan had a vow to obey the king (Aerys desired them tortuosly killed), an oath to protect the young and innocent (both Starks were full-grown and ""threatened"" Rhaegar), and personal honor was told to take a back seat. He made an ethically appropriate decision. I am going to continue to hope Barristan was not on guard during the Rhaella rapes. The only information we have is that Jaime and Jon Darry were there. For the ease of my argument, lets continue to wish that was the typical case.

Barristan wants to be a simple man, but he has led a complicated life. This quote is not facetious, it is the real Barristan.

>""Prince Rhaegar had two children,"" Ser Barristan told him. ""Rhaenys was a little girl, Aegon a babe in arms. When Tywin Lannister took King's Landing, his men killed both of them. He served the bloody bodies up in crimson cloaks, a gift for the new king."" And what did Robert say when he saw them? Did he smile? Barristan Selmy had been badly wounded on the Trident, so he had been spared the sight of Lord Tywin's gift, but oft he wondered. If I had seen him smile over the red ruins of Rhaegar's children, no army on this earth could have stopped me from killing him. ""I will not suffer the murder of children. Accept that, or I'll have no part of this."" 

Barristan the **Bold** is the greatest Knight in the Seven Kingdoms and the most honorable leader in Essos. May he live forever and the show can get stuffed.",SPOILER
"I was going through Steven Attewell's Race for the Iron Throne blog, and I read something that made me want to kick myself for not thinking about it first. 

He talks about how Ned didn't use his powers of the Hand well enough. For example, to compel Ser Hugh to give testimony, or by summoning Northern loyalists to replace the members of the Small Council. 

It's the last point that stuck with me. You guys think Ned could have lasted longer if he'd canned Varys and Littlefinger and brought down someone like Galbart Glover, or maybe one of the Karstarks, or hell, anyone else with more loyalties to him than to anyone in King's Landing?

I want to say yes, but then I have to wonder if the newcomers would have been as competent as the people they were replacing. Or if Varys or LF would try to sabotage their replacements from behind the scenes.  I kinda suck at figuring out all the possible repercussions, so I'm putting the question out there:

Should Ned have appointed northmen to the Small Council and done away with Varys, LF, and Pycelle?   ",SPOILER

"I noticed this little bit of foreshadowing while rereading some Jon chapters from ACOK. Jon's always been very observant and it looks like he may have gotten the idea of which abandoned forts to reopen by listening to Lord Commander Mormont and Qhorin Halfhand talk.


>The Old Bear unrolled a map, frowned at it, tossed it aside, opened another. He was pondering where the hammer would fall, Jon could see it. The Watch had once manned seventeen castles along the hundred leagues of the Wall, but they had been abandoned one by one as the brotherhood dwindled. Only three were now garrisoned, a fact that Mance Rayder knew as well as they did. ""Ser Alliser Thorne will bring back fresh levies from King's Landing, we can hope. If we man **Greyguard** from the Shadow Tower and the **Long Barrow** from Eastwatch . . .""

>""Greyguard has largely collapsed. Stonedoor would serve better, if the men could be found. **Icemark** and **Deep Lake** as well, mayhaps. With daily patrols along the battlements between.""
---Jon V ACOK


#



>""True enough,"" the small man said. ""Is it just to be **Icemark**, then, or will m'lord be opening t'other forts as well?""

>""I mean to garrison all of them, in time,"" said Jon, ""but for the moment, it will just be **Icemark** and **Greyguard**.""
---Jon II ADWD


#



>""The wildlings will remain upon the Wall,"" Jon assured them. ""Most will be housed in one of our abandoned castles."" The Watch now had garrisons at **Icemark**, **Long Barrow**, Sable Hall, **Greyguard**, and **Deep Lake**, all badly undermanned, but ten castles still stood empty and abandoned.
---Jon XI ADWD


So by the end of ADWD four of five forts they talked about have been reopened. I never picked up on this detail until today but it really goes to show how Jon listens to and learns from those in command. Part of what makes his ADWD arc so great is how he's always incorporating stuff he heard from Ned, Mormont, Qhorin, Mance, and Maester Aemon into his own leadership style.",SPOILER
"In my recent Names of Legend post, I pointed out the similarities between Orson Scott Card's Ender Quartet and Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. This post expands upon these similarities with an eye for the language of the Children of the Forest/pequeninos.

Both Jon and Ender show initiative in wanting to speak with a species alien to themselves. From Tyrion, to the Free Folk, to the Others, Jon has shown a natural tendency toward understanding his enemies.
A Speaker for the Dead's profession revolves around the same understanding of people.

>""I'll do everything I can,"" said the Speaker, ""but first I have to know you, or how can I tell your story?""

>-Ch. 14 ""Renegades"", Speaker for the Dead

>""Can they talk?"" asked Jon Snow...

>""My lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies. We understand little of the wights and less about the Others. We need to learn.""

>-Jon VIII, ADWD

Ender seeks out the Pequeninos to seek aid in a manner akin to the Last Hero, without the whole being chased by ice demons thing. He also creates a treaty, similar to the Pact forged between First Men and Children.

>**The harvesting of the trees** soon brought the First Men into conflict with the children of the forest, however, and for hundreds and thousands of years they made war upon one another, until the First Men **took the old gods of the children for their own** and **divided up the lands in the Pact** sealed on the Isle of Faces amidst the great lake called the Gods Eye.

>-The Stormlands: The Coming of the First Men, TWOIAF

>Piggy law applied within the forest, and all humans who came into the forest were subject to it. Human law applied within the fence, and all piggies who came there were subject to human government. **All the rest of the planet would be divided up later.**

>-Ch. 17 ""The Wives"", Speaker for the Dead

>""Renegades. Those who have denied their own people, and **claimed the enemy as their own**.""

>-Ch. 14 ""Renegades"", Speaker for the Dead

We see both the similarities and differences between the two events. They both 'divide up' the lands between their two races and the humans take on the Children/pequeninos as their own kind. The First Men and Children combine their gods, serving only the Old Gods and taking on their enemy's beliefs as their own. The pequeninos and Lusitanians don't mix gods but treat their two species as a shared tribe facing the same problems.

Ender and his crew also play into Brandon the Builder, learning the language and behavior differences between humans and pequeninos. We see a couple of these peculiar language differences during key moments in ASOIAF.

>""We humans,"" said the Speaker, ""use tools of stone or metal to cut down trees, when we want to shape them...""

>It took a moment for the Speaker's words to sink in. Then, suddenly, all the piggies were on their feet. They began **running around, madly, purposelessly**, sometimes bumping into each other or into trees or the log houses. Most of them were silent, but now and then one of them would wail, exactly as they had cried out a few minutes ago. It was eerie, the almost silent insanity of the piggies, as if they had **suddenly lost control of their bodies**. All the years of careful noncommunication, refraining from telling the piggies anything, and now Speaker breached that policy and **the result was this madness**.

>-Ch. 14 ""Renegades"", Speaker for the Dead

Here we have a callback to the First Men and Children's fighting with the cutting down of trees. The reaction it provokes is unsettling but most importantly occurs during a high magic moment in the fighting pits of Meereen.

>Another fell away, shaken loose by the beating of his wings. Below, she saw men whirling, wreathed in flame, hands up in the air **as if caught in the throes of some mad dance**.

>-Daenerys X, ADWD

I've postulated before that the fighting pits and this ""mad dance"" is some sort of aberrant behavior of the magical godheads we witness in ASOIAF, controlling everyone during that moment. We see this idea shown directly by the piggies in their silent insanity, seemingly losing control of their own bodies. This same mechanism is evidenced by the buggers' hive queen and their control over their workers in a form of mind control. Returning to the language differences:

>Leaf-eater cried out from the edge of the forest, a terrible **keening cry**, an unbearable grief. ...

>""When I tell this story to the wives,"" said Human, ""you'll hear grief so terrible that it will sound like **the breaking of trees in a thunderstorm**."" ...

>But behind them they could hear the voices of the wives, singing a **terrible and cacophonous song**...the sound of the wives' **keening**...

>-Ch. 17 ""The Wives"", Speaker for the Dead

In a post a few months ago I identified the similarities between Waymar's encounter with the Others and the birthing of dragons. I pointed out the similarities between Waymar's and the Other's keening clash and Mirri Maz Duur's singing. Here we see the keening and the singing as one and the same.

The grief of the piggies is again indirectly tied to mind control in the ASOIAF text through the use of the Dragonbinder horn. The same horn Euron uses to sway the men of the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot makes the same cacophonous cry.

>It seemed as if the sound would never end. It was like some long scream. **A thousand screams, all melted into one**.

>-Victarion I, ADWD

The last piece of 'language' I will touch on here is a cry of pain.

>Mandachuva suddenly cried out, a hideous cry that Miro had never heard before, **like an animal dying**. **""This is how we show pain,""** whispered Human.

>-Ch. 14 ""Renegades"", Speaker for the Dead

Throughout ASOIAF there are a number of scenes using heavily symbolic language and certain actions or behaviors serving as signposts in the narrative scenery. Some of these signposts include laughter in battle, a weapon too cumbersome to wield, a character holding up a gauntlet or severed arm to an opponent, or as shown above: an animalistic cry.

>The dragon descended on him, roaring, and all at once **the poor beast was aflame**, yet somehow he kept on running, **screaming with every step**, until Drogon landed on him and broke his back.

>-Daenerys X, ADWD

During the Battle of Whispering Wood, Cat has a moment where she sees magic, blinks, and it's gone. As the fight commences we get:

>She heard hoofbeats, iron boots splashing in shallow water, the woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel, the hiss of arrows, the thunder of drums, **the terrified screaming of a thousand horses**.

>-Catelyn X, AGOT

During the Battle of the Blackwater we see the pain of the trees.

>She burst like an overripe fruit, but no fruit had ever **screamed that shattering wooden scream**. From inside her Davos saw green gushing from a thousand broken jars, poison from **the entrails of a dying beast**...

>-Davos II, ACOK

We keep seeing the same motif of this animalistic cry. Should the original intent hold true this is a sign of the Children's grief, specifically regarding the destructive nature of men towards their own and other species.

>""The Andals burnt out the weirwood groves, hacked down the faces, slaughtered the children where they found them, and everywhere proclaimed the triumph of the Seven over the old gods. So the children fled north""î""

>**Summer began to howl.**

>-Bran VII, AGOT

For a final piece of evidence on this language in ASOIAF, there is a threat to hang Ender so that he gets no third life. 'The third life' is the piggies' form of transformation into their next life as a tree.
This ties in with Bloodraven's promise to Bran of 'the second life' in the weirwood consciousness. Lastly, let's look at a quote tying together hanging and the breaking of a tree in a thunderstorm.

>They came upon the first corpse a mile from the crossroads. He swung beneath the limb of **a dead tree whose blackened trunk still bore the scars of the lightning that had killed it**.

>-Brienne VII, AFFC

We see the invoking of a tree killed by lightning and a hanging. This could be interpreted as the Children's anger at the destruction of their trees, the 'breaking of trees in a thunderstorm', thus lashing out and denying someone
the next life. But this is the difficulty of looking across these works and transplanting ideas. They are always cut up and mixed around in a mythological re-purposing/re-telling of story beats. Using Martin's song motif we could refer to these changes to the same core melody as variations on a narrative theme.",SPOILER
"Steffon Baratheon is a very important figure in our story, if he hadn't died the events of our story would be very different and I can't help but think that his death and the overall plot around him was very stupid and underwhelming. So we don't know much about Steffon, he fought in the war of the Ninepenny Kings and became good friends with Aerys, fast forward a lot of years and Aerys is king. Aerys needs a wife for his firstborn son and heir Rhaegar, so he entrusts his friend Steffon to go out to find a bride ""of noble birth from an old Valyrian bloodline"" and Steffon fails. This just doesn't make any sense to me, what noble lord of Valyrian descent would not want one of their daughters or whatever to be married to the future King of the Iron Throne? There should be hordes of people lining up to present themselves to Steffon to see if they are a suitable fit for the Prince, hell Oberyn Martell was able to find a valyrian noblewoman to bang and had a bastard with her. I dont see how Oberyn is capable of going to Volantis on his own and finding a Valyrian noblewoman and Steffon, an envoy of the King of the Iron Throne is not.  


 So Steffon decides to come back, instead of reporting to the King of his failures, he decides to go home for a quick visit first. But good old Steffon decides that going through a place called Shipbreaker Bay is the wisest course of action. Yes our main man Steffon decides to go through a place infamous for destroying ships with his ship. While in Shipbreaker Bay, a storm happens and this really bugs me. So were there no signs that a storm was going to happen before choosing to sail through Shipbreaker Bay? If there were then Steffon is an idiot who is putting the lives of himself, his wife (speaking of which, why is Cassana Estermont even with Steffon on this journey in the first place?) and hundreds of people in danger. If there were signs of a storm which would make sense prior to a storm happening and Steffon for some reason still wanted to go through Shipbreaker Bay anyway then why didn't any of the sailors or navigators talk Steffon out of sailing past Shipbreaker Bay?  


As for the storm itself, firstly, the fact that it happened is a huge coincidence but the fact that it happened so close to Steffon's destination and the fact that 2 of his children were conveniently awake and present to witness this convenient storm conveniently destroying their fathers ship, knocks the ball straight out of the park. What makes the events even more bizarre is that Patchface is the ONLY person who survived the storm. Robert and Stannis could see their father's ship before it smashed, this means that they were very close to Storms End. After Steffon's ship was destroyed, excluding Patchface there were no survivors. This again is incredibly dumb to me, the people there were within sight of Storm's End, was there really no-one capable of swimming a few hundred meters towards the harbour where the ship was headed for?  


Steffon undeniably is a very important character and if he didn't die then there probably would be no Robert's Rebellion, it's really annoying to see that his mini storyline is a tragic comedy riddled with plotholes and questions that will never be answered.",SPOILER
"I've been seeing these deathpools go around the web in preparation for the final season of Game of Thrones. Filling out my own form, I found myself stuck on one name: Sansa Stark. I couldn't really decide what fate holds in store for her, I couldn't imagine her actively bearing arms agains the white walkers, obviously her political prowess will be useless against them, so what's her purpose?

Next season we'll see Sansa reunited with her husband Tyrion Lannister, another character whose uses politics and social positioning as a weapon. Is it possible that both Sansa and Tyrion might see the continuation of their marriage as a powerful alliance? If so, might it also be possible that Sansa takes Tyrion's side as the Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West?

Assuming the books head in, relatively, the same direction as the show, we'll see Cersei Lannister struggle to give up her position in Kings Landing to aid in the Great War. However, it is known that Cersei must meet some kind of demise, save for some prophecy-altering events. If Jamie doesn't go down with her, it's unlikely he'll lay claim to the seat of the Westerlands.

I think it'd be quite poetic. She essentially replaces her greatest mentor (Cersei) and rules over the home where she was raised. She becomes the Lady of House Lannister and getting her fairy tale ending, albeit a stunted version of what she'd hoped for. If the kingdom becomes decentralized and Kings Landing falls, might we see some of our surviving heroes trying to rebuild Westeros as The Free Kingdoms, and rule over the castles that still stand? Is that too optimistic?

Anyway just a thought, this is Dream of Spring type stuff, so we might never know where this ultimately lands. I do like the idea though, so here's hoping for Lemoncakes Lannister.",SPOILER
"Part 1 is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ao8sq3/spoilers_extended_sansa_the_clueless_part_1/

Part 2 is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/apm0uk/spoilers_extended_sansa_the_clueless_part_2/

The gist here is that Sansa often does not understand the activities or the conversations that she is part of, and for that reason the reader must dig into the subtext to find out what is really going on.

Part 3 is the convo with Randa on the way down the Giant's Lance. Some of this has already been discussed in text and video, but it's worth repeating:

First, Randa asks Alayne how old she is. Alayne replies 14, because she has decided that Alayne should be older than Sansa Stark. Now, we don't know exactly how much Randa knows about Alayne's backstory, since it is impolite to pry into a man's natural children, but if Sansa and Littlefinger stick to the story they concocted back on the Fingers, this is a blatant lie. Why? Because that story has Littlefinger fathering Sansa upon a gentlewoman from Braavos whom Petyr met in Gulltown when he had charge of the port. If you'll recall, however, when Tyrion went digging into Petyr's past just prior to the Battle of the Blackwater, which took place in 299, LF was appointed to only a minor sinecure in customs 10 years prior -- in 289 -- and one would imagine that it would take a least a year to work your way up to ""charge of the port."" But even if his rise was instantaneous, by the time Sansa and Randa have their conversation, in the year 300, Sansa should be 12 years old at best.

The second flub is Sansa blurting out Jon Snow when Randa mentions the new commander of the Nights Watch. Most comments I've seen say the disconnect is that Alayne would happen to know the name of Ned Stark's bastard but not who Harold Hardyng is, but I think the real kicker is that Alayne seems not to care one wit that the new High Septon has just been chosen. Remember, the cover story is that Sansa was raised by the faith after her mother died, and she was being groomed as a septa. So the fact that the new HS is in place -- to replace the man who died suddenly in his sleep who, in turn, replaced the man who was torn apart (and perhaps eaten) by a mob -- but none of this produces even the slightest reaction in a girl who lived and breathed the faith until a few years ago ought to be a huge red flag to someone supposedly as clever as Myranda Royce.

The other part of Sansa's story is the Petyr did not even know of her existence until she flowered and decided not to become a septa, which would have happened in the past year or two. I haven't seen Alayne flub this fact yet, but I'll be looking for it in Winds. ",SPOILER

Title.

I was just thinking this as I was reorganizing my bookshelf and was putting the Sword of Truth series back.

We know that George likes to add name play to his characters, having the Seasame Street Tullys. Wun-Wun being a play on the New York Giants QB. There is a Harry Potter reference somewhere, I dont remember where but its there.

Anyway he also likes to subvert tropes and the like and Mord the gaoler is almost exactly opposite of any Mord-Sith in the sword of truth series. Being a fat ugly guy with bad fitting leathers, compared to a fit and sexy, skin tight leather bound woman.

Just a random thought I had and would be cool to know whether or not it was intended or just random name picking.",SPOILER
"I remember watching The Godfather and Sopranos, and anytime any oranges or orange juice was showed, it would signify a death or something bad about to happen.

"The Dance of the Dragons meant that the Targaryens could not exert as much control as they could in the past because they lost their '""nukes.""ù But the Blackfyre rebellions were the beginning of the end of their family. 

I know I will get downvoted for this, but Daeron the Good was merely a decent king and not a great one since it seems like the large support for the Blackfyres was a direct result of his policies that favored Dorne, and in particular House Martell, which explains why they received support from Dorne's second largest house Yronwood. From there, we now have rebellions that last for 70 years and it seems that again they last so long as a result of Daeron's policies. I doubt Daemon and Bittersteel would have garnered the support they did if so many lesser houses and an alienated region - the Reach - did not have the grievances they did with his policies. He was able to lessen support from the Stormlands by marrying two of his four sons to Stormland houses, but now the end of House Targaryen is solely dependent on the loyalty of a few major houses. 

And it dwindles from that point forward. As soon as House Baratheon and House Arryn, two of the most loyal houses to Tagaryen, turn on them, it's the automatic end of their dynasty. What's more is that no one with the exception of the Martells and Darry even misses or wants them back. Dany has to get dragons, invade, and force herself on Westeros like Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters to get her kingdom back. 

Furthermore, as much as we talk about the fantastical peace the Targaryen dynasty gave Westeros, it's a very fleeting one. In 300 years, I never sense there is national unity in this kingdom. Dorne never feels like it is part of the Kingdom despite the favoritism; it always feels like a kingdom of its own disconnected from the rest. 

Just my thoughts on it. ",SPOILER
"If there's an Asoiaf character whom this question should apply to, it's definitely  *the* character who embodies the theme of kingship, Stannis Baratheon. 

Unlike many other characters of the series, Stannis bases his claim and directs his actions under the pretext of righteousness. **Stannis, ideal *custos*, lives and kills by the rules.** (1) 

However, who watches this particular watchman?

The question is even more interesting because""¶

## ""¶Stannis Baratheon is actually righteous

The sources are GRRM himself(2)  and the Asoiaf books. (3)

Here's the kicker to spice things up: *one thing is doing the rightful thing, another doing the right thing.*

Example: Jon Snow/Davos snatching children away from Stannis is""¶ not rightful. But it's the right thing to do. Stannis' entire campaign, on the opposite, is made of things that are rightful but not necessarily right.

The paradox continues because, even better, **of all the kings in Asoiaf, Stannis is the one who has the proper Right.**

- Balon and Euron Greyjoy go by right of conquest. 

For them this is actually a point of honor, it's exactly how the Ironborn way is supposed to be.

- Robb Stark's right is self-proclaimed.

It's the northern lords who decide it, regardless of any current law.
 
- Renly and the Lannisters follow the doctrine of right by might.

In that sense both Renly's speech to Catelyn and Tywin's whenever he's speaking are self-evident.
 
Of all the regents, the only one who could have some righteousness beside Stannis is Daenerys Targaryen. *Too bad that her rights involves Westeros only. Certainly not Essos, where she is 100% an usurper.* 

Unlike the other kings, the righteous Stannis promises one thing: justice. And the promise is scary in itself, because the alternative is death.

>""With this sword I defend my subjects and destroy those who menace them. Bend the knee, and I promise you food, land, and justice. Kneel and live.

But if he's actually rightful, what's to be scared of? In my opinion the answer lies in the expression '""two weights and two measures""ù. The problem with Stannis is called double standards.

## Justice and paradoxes

Justice is a concept really dear to Stannis, and the term shows up from time to time.

>""I shall bring justice to Westeros. A thing Ser Axell understands as little as he does war.""Westeros has but one king,"" said Stannis. His voice rang harsh, with none of Melisandre's music. 

Stannis wants the people (all his subordinates, technically) to respect the law, under the basis that he has the right to rule. He has it. And since Asoiaf is about a medieval-like society during war, **Stannis creates and enforces the law, at the same time.** But who watches the watchmen? Because intentions and actions, in Stannis' case, are a total paradox.

GRRM pulls out one of Asoiaf greatest moves, namely providing Stannis a lot of technical justifications for *whatever* he does. Emphasis on the word '""technical""ù, because **the devil is in the details.** It leaves the judgment up to the reader. Here are some acts he wants to have justice for:

* 1 Justice against murder

>I will have justice for him. Aye, and for Ned Stark and Jon Arryn as well.""
""And for Renly?"" The words were out before Davos could stop to consider them. 

Let's conveniently ignore the fact that Stannis *self*-inflicted punishment is just 

>I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brother's peach.""
because ultimately Renly was guilty of treason. 

*What about the innocent Edric Storm, who Davos has to kidnap?*

* 2 Justice against infidelity

>The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark. For such crimes there must be justice.

*Stannis is guilty of infidelity too* (oddly enough there's a '""baby""ù involved as well). Oh well, war is war, right? 

""¶not exactly: Stannis did use Melisandre's bed multiple times, as Melisandre's chapter in ADwD notes.
It's not like Selyse refuses him. She would gladly lay with Stannis and she asked for it.

* 3 Justice against past crimes

Davos Seaworth gets  through a next level manicure session for his past crime, contraband. Davos himself calls that act justice.

What about other questionable individual in Stannis' entourage? The prime example being at the Wall, where some people get gelded or hanged and others are left untouched *given their status.* Two weights, two measures?

On Stannis's side, I advocate pragmatism. The counterpoint, however, is quite evident: '""does this mean that as long as I'm useful I can do pretty much what I want?""ù Sounds convenient. 

>""Clayton Suggs as well, I do not doubt."" 
""Him, Corliss Penny, all the rest. Even Ser Richard here, who only loves the Lord of Light when it suits his purposes.""

What's the difference between Richard Horpe and Stannis, by the way?

Tldr; Who watches the watchman?

"(Taken from my Goodreads account)

I went into this book with a good idea of what to expect: Almost all of the most interesting characters removed and placed in the sequel. I accepted the fact long before I bought the book, so I went in ready to enjoy the story for whatever it was. I wasn't clouded with anger or disappointment over a lack of Jon or Bran (though that is a bad move structurally!) I just got ready to read whatever Martin deigned to give.

And it was actually much better than I'd hoped for. Other reviews say the book is boring and plot-less and rambling, and that's true to some extent. However, I read the book more as a focus on the characters and world, rather than whatever plot twists might spring up, and to that end the book was really good.

Cersei and Brienne make major-POV debuts, and their characters were very well developed. It was fun seeing Cersei's bitterness and paranoia, especially at the start of the book with some very creepy ideas running through her mind. The beginning of this book is actually very atmospheric.

Brienne's plot felt a bit meandering, but was fun in a road-trip sort of way, basically serving as a tour of the war-torn Westeros. The war may be over, but the destruction is not done, and it was fun trying to pick apart the truths from the fictions that Brienne hears, as well as experience some of the situations see gets into. Rough stuff.

Most importantly for my enjoyment, this book has something I haven't felt since the first book: a development of plot. I said in my review of ""A Storm of Swords"" that the whole book felt like characters wandering about before their Bad Thing happens. The plot here actually progresses in steps, with characters furthering their own plots, rather than just being screwed around by the other characters. Cersei's plot in particular was the best at this.


As for the negatives in this book, the prose was much more difficult to get through. So many times, Martin will just endlessly list off descriptions. If a character walks by a farm, you will get a list of the animals. If a character is riding aboard a ship, you WILL know what that ship is carrying, in the form of a long pointless list of its materials.
Minor characters are listed off as well. Every time a character enters a room, you have to read the names of the dozen characters also in that room, as well as their sigil, and probably family history. Characters also go on LONG inner monologues within their own head, and sometimes the information is repetitive.
All these problems lead to a book that feels REALLY slow at times, and definitely affected the quality. And with new POV characters, (who I have not named) the problem gets far worse.

For the most part, these problems could be ignored. The book IS good at expanding a world that feels very much alive, the lore, and the character development. And beneath the extreme bloat of prose is a good story, and I'll remember the good far more than the bad.

"In ADWD, Roose tells Theon pretending to be Reek that his high birth betrays his tongue, and asks him to say *m'lord* instead of *my lord*. The show has a similar scene where Arya is corrected  by Lord Tywin who calls her out as a highborn, saying lowborn girls say *milord* not *my lord*. Given Arya in the books served Roose Bolton, many fans have wondered why Roose didn't spot   Arya speaking like a highborn (it's the very same person who corrects Theon three books later). It has also led to theories about how Roose really knew it was Arya Stark, and meant for her to escape purposefully leaving the map on table etc. 

As I see it, maybe Roose recognized Arya, but if so that has more to do with her similarity and his familiarity with Lyanna Stark, not her speaking style. I tend to think he didn't mean for her to escape, and he certainly didn't leave the map on table for her to find. Because Rooose Bolton is not Littlefinger to just leave such matters to uncertain variables and watch how things progress. If Roose wanted Arya to die, he could have ordered her death any time citing an alleged disobedience and no one would have questioned him. If he wanted her to reach Riverrun he could have sent her there. If he wanted her to die outside Harrenhal he has easier ways of doing so without losing a valuable map. We know from SSM that Roose was undecided about the planned betrayal of Robb's cause as late as Jaime's visit to Harrenhal. If he knew he had Arya Stark under custody, he would not have played with that piece of the game as he does with most other men. 

But, Arya keep addressing him as *my lord* throughout her time as cupbearer. Why? Let's look at the first time she calls him *my lord*. 

> The lord regarded her. Only his eyes moved; they were very pale, the color of ice. ""How old are you, child?""
> 
> She had to think for a moment to remember. ""Ten.""
> ""Ten, ***my lord,***"" **he reminded her**. ""Are you fond of animals?""
>
> ""Some kinds. My lord.""
> A thin smile twitched across his lips. 

We think he is smiling because his next question is a joke, about how the 'some kinds' do not include lions (Lannister sigil) or manticores (Lorch sigil). But maybe he is smiling that he taught courtesy to a low-born girl who have never interacted close to a lord. If it was a highborn girl like Sansa, she would have said ""ten, my lord"" like most girls educated in courtesy. Even Gendry claims that his master *taught* him courtesy, to address highborn ladies as *m'lady*. Arya's behavior is not that of a highborn, nor that of a smallfolk who has even remote association with lordlings. As Bolton sees it, Arya is the lowest of the low. She is saying 'my lord' because *he* taught her to. The smallfolk who say m'lord are taught by other smallfolk, and they say that they are used to. Weasel's first lesson in courtesy is from a high lord, and that's why she talks properly. 

**TL;DR** **From Roose's point of view, Arya is saying 'my lord' because *he* taught her to.**",SPOILER

"I know people have mixed opinions about the Brienne chapters in AFFC, and I agree that they have their ups and downs, but I think her fourth chapter, the one where she reaches the Whispers with Nimble Dick and Podrick, is amazing. It has this great fairy-tale-like feel as Dick recounts stories of the heads at the Whispers, the Crabbs, Cracklaw Point, and the Squishers, while Brienne tells the tale of Ser Galladon and his Valyrian steel sword Red Rain. All the while there's a dark underbelly as we wonder whether Dick is being honest or if he's playing them false, which establishes great tension.

The locations they travel through, with the cliffs, forlorn castles and ruins, and thick forest that hides much of the sky from view, feel very fresh and establish an eery tone. The environment descriptions here are some of George's best.

Brienne, for me, is very relatable. Being a shy person, I can relate to her apprehension of others and her difficulty to develop meaningful relationships. Although her reasons for being this way are different than my own, her actions and feelings are very similar.

Of course, there's also Podrick, who, like me, has difficulty looking people in the eyes and is often tongue-tied. There are not many shy characters in the series, and seeing him develop a relationship with Brienne is wonderful.

The ending is quite tragic.

I think it is honor, responsibility and children that bind them together, not romantic love.

&#x200B;

Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand have four daughters, but they seldom talk about their children while they are together. They kiss and tease and find ease in each other's company. Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark had a lot of shared interests such as riding, jousting and singing. I could imagine that they would talk more about these things than their child. That is what romantic relationship looks like. Children are just by-products of a marriage and they should never take center stage in a couple's life. ",SPOILER

**Harrenhal:**

&#x200B;

The tourney of Harrenhal was a magical event. It's being held in a cursed castle that's literally built out of blood and fire, next to the most magical place in Westeros.

&#x200B;

The characters that were there, speak of it like it was the last day of summer camp or their high-school prom. The nostalgia is so thick that it could be used as a metaphor for Dunk.

&#x200B;

Ned's memories tell us,

>It was the year of false spring, and he was eighteen again, down from the Eyrie to the tourney at Harrenhal. He could see the deep green of the grass, and smell the pollen on the wind. Warm days and cool nights and the sweet taste of wine. He remembered Brandon's laughter, and Robert's berserk valor in the melee, the way he laughed as he unhorsed men left and right. He remembered Jaime Lannister, a golden youth in scaled white armor, kneeling on the grass in front of the king's pavilion and making his vows to protect and defend King Aerys

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While Barristan tells it,

&#x200B;

>The tourney Lord Whent staged at Harrenhal beside the Gods Eye, in the year of the false spring. A notable event. Besides the jousting, there was a m√™l√©e in the old style fought between seven teams of knights, as well as archery and axe-throwing, a horse race, a tournament of singers, a mummer show, and many feasts and frolics. Lord Whent was as open handed as he was rich. The lavish purses he proclaimed drew hundreds of challengers. Even your royal father came to Harrenhal, when he had not left the Red Keep for long years. The greatest lords and mightiest champions of the Seven Kingdoms rode in that tourney, and the Prince of Dragonstone bested them all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is conspiracy and intrigue going on with the older generation, but for Ned and Robert's generation it was more like a teen movie than ASOIAF.

&#x200B;

Even the *bullies* are wholesome (well, for GRRM anyway) and serve a purpose. The she-wolf takes on three opponents and sends them away yelping, with their tails between their legs. Compare that to Brienne's far more GRRM-esque encounter with three opponents that resulted in injury, death, and grief.

&#x200B;

One of the major themes of the series, repeated over and over again, is that life is not like the stories.

&#x200B;

*But at Harrenhal, it was*!!

&#x200B;

\- A brave young girl proves that she is as strong as any boy.

\- A shy boy gets his first kiss (headcanon alert) from the beautiful girl.

\- Robert wins the melee, laughing loudly as he unhorses people left and right.

\- The handsome prince wins the main event.

\- A mystery knight appears and disappears again.

\- Possibly even a forbidden love blossoming.

&#x200B;

The only one who doesn't view the tourney of Harrenhal with rose-tinted (pun intended) glasses, is Jaime. Jaime had his moment of magic at the very start, but was then sent back to Kings Landing. He now associates the tourney as the moment that his world was shattered and all his illusions were stripped away. The day he was '""soiled""ù.

&#x200B;

For everyone else, that moment would come shortly""¶

&#x200B;

**The Moment all the Smiles Died:**

&#x200B;

>Robert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the field after unhorsing Ser Barristan in the final tilt to claim the champion's crown. Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty's laurel in Lyanna's lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost

&#x200B;

For Ned at least, this was the moment when *ALL* the smiles died. A moment of such significance and impact that Westeros shook. This was the moment when life stopped being a story. From here on in he was in George's territory and it was years of death, loss, grief, forced marriage, war, more death, betrayals, even more death etc. etc.

&#x200B;

Whatever magic had been in the air that spring, vanished. This was no longer kids having the time of their lives, suddenly this was men grown, on the verge of war. It was real-life again. With real-life consequences.

&#x200B;

This moment, and its consequences, have been discussed in great depth. The ramifications that Rhaegar's actions had on his house and the seven kingdoms is well-known.

&#x200B;

One thing I haven't seen discussed however (though I've no doubt that it has been) is the idea that Rhaegar's actions *brought back the fucking winter!* Pardon my Dothraki.

&#x200B;

**The False Spring:**

&#x200B;

A lot of people have wondered how Rhaegar knew that Lyanna was the one he needed to birth TPTWP. Most put it down to Lyanna being a northerner.

&#x200B;

She's from the North, its cold up North, therefore Lyanna is Ice, QED.

&#x200B;

That's a *lot* of supposition to gamble your life, your family's lives, and your entire kingdom on. Not to mention all human life on Westeros and beyond, if prophecy is to be believed.

&#x200B;

I would argue that at the time of the tourney, Rhaegar had \**no idea\** that Lyanna was the girl he needed.

&#x200B;

It was well after the tourney that Aegon was born and at this time Rhaegar still seemed to be pretty confident that Aegon would be TPTWP,

&#x200B;

>""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.

&#x200B;

>""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the time of the tourney, and for some time afterward, Rhaegar felt that his children with Elia would fulfil the prophecy.

&#x200B;

So what changed his mind?

&#x200B;

**The Winter Rose:**

&#x200B;

It can't have escaped the very magic-conscious prince that placing a crown of winter roses on the lap of a daughter of Winterfell, seemed to cause the seasons to shift dramatically.

&#x200B;

I personally believe that a winter rose causing winter to rise is a pun too delicious to be coincidence.

&#x200B;

Winter rose alright. *It rose with a vengeance.*

&#x200B;

>And well it might, for with that simple garland of pale blue roses, Rhaegar Targaryen had begun the dance that would rip the Seven Kingdoms apart, bring about his own death and thousands more, and put a welcome new king upon the Iron Throne.

&#x200B;

>The False Spring of 281 AC lasted less than two turns. As the year drew to a close, winter returned to Westeros with a vengeance. On the last day of the year, snow began to fall upon King's Landing, and a crust of ice formed atop the Blackwater Rush. The snowfall continued off and on for the best part of a fortnight, by which time the Blackwater was hard frozen, and icicles draped the roofs and gutters of every tower in the city.

&#x200B;

>As cold winds hammered the city, King Aerys II turned to his pyromancers, charging them to drive the winter off with their magics. Huge green fires burned along the walls of the Red Keep for a moon's turn. Prince Rhaegar was not in the city to observe them, however. Nor could he be found in Dragonstone with Princess Elia and their young son, Aegon. With the coming of the new year, the crown prince had taken to the road with half a dozen of his closest friends and confidants, on a journey that would ultimately lead him back to the riverlands. Not ten leagues from Harrenhal, Rhaegar fell upon Lyanna Stark of Winterfell, and carried her off, lighting a fire that would consume his house and kin and all those he loved""îand half the realm besides.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Rhaegar and Lyanna reunited at the God's Eye in 282 with winter still in full flow. Even the Blackwater is frozen. Yet we know that in 283 Robert met Rhaegar on the Trident, much farther north than the Blackwater, and there is no word of any ice or snow.

&#x200B;

It seems as if winter has been retreating for a bit of time""¶*maybe nine months or thereabouts*?

&#x200B;

That probably doesn't add up on the timeline perfectly but there's no denying that another seasonal shift occurred at around the time of them reuniting.

&#x200B;

Rhaegar and Lyanna's coming together seems to have noticeable effects on the seasons of Westeros (which GRRM has said are magical in nature) and now their blood will be the linchpin in the ultimate seasonal change.

&#x200B;

The Long Winter.

There's theories that they might be resurrected especially since that teaser trailer for season 8 but surely they are just bones or ash by now? Unless their bodies were preserved in some way?,SPOILER
"I am rewatching season 5, and I'm up to the point where Tommen storms into Cersei's room and demands that she release Ser Loras from the dungeon. It got me thinking about how innocent he is, and how ineffective he is when it comes to negotiating. It got also me thinking about his later death at the end of Season 6.

I think the writers missed a huge opportunity for a dramatic conversation between Tommen and Cersei. He just kills himself without a word, but I am just curious who else thinks a heated conversation where Cersei gradually wins Tommen over to her side would be cool to watch? I think the story could have gone any number of fun ways if they didnt decide to just kill Tommen off like that. 

 He was basically ignoring her all season leading up to that point, and the explosion of the Sept of Baelor could have been the desperate act Cersei needed to get through to him. Instead it was the end of him, and somehow the entire Faith Militant (which seems like utter BS that an entire army and all its supporters would be wiped out after one building, comfortably holding 700 people, explodes,) and somehow tied all of Cersei's immediate problems up in a neat little bow. That ending reminded me of like a knock off of how Walter White kills his enemies at the end of Season 4 of Breaking Bad. It frustrates me somewhat. Not to mention the unfortunate deaths of the Tyrells and Kevan Lannister, but they were doomed anyway I suppose.

I think some psychological exploration and growth of King Tommen would have been really fascinating to see. How he struggles with his identity as a king and a pious man, while dealing with his crazy, controlling, mother. He might even start to ""break bad,"" as it were, himself, the more he faces the realities of the world he is set to rule. Instead we get very little development from him, and an untimely death. It seems like a waste, story wise. ",SPOILER
"Are Craster's Sons host' for someone else's soul?  Are the Others a frozen walking tomb for some unlucky dead?  Like a Stark that wasn't buried in the proper fashion in the crypts of Winter Hell?  In the show we see the Night King turn Craster's last Son.  Did someone's soul take up residence in that child?  If so, who could it be?  ""Only death can pay for life""?

IDK, random tin foil thoughts. ",SPOILER
"I could be completely off base on my memory and it has admittedly been a while since I read the books, but I've been rewatching the show and am reminded of an observation I had before.


The climate up North, at The Wall, and Beyond the Wall seems to be much colder in the show than it is in the books. Near The Wall, it appears to be freezing and has snow all the time despite the fact that The Gift appears to be in books able to be cultivated as farmland. Then Beyond the Wall, it's literally a frozen tundra. There are supposedly 100,000 people with Mance. That seems to be an impossible number of people to support just on hunting and gathering in a tundra.


Is my memory wrong? I never remember getting the sense that it was *that* cold in late Summer/Autumn. Is this also just a GRRM math error in that he just fucked up how many wildlings there are?",SPOILER
"I love the depth of the world building, it truly feels like it's a real world. It has a deep and rich history, which is enjoyable by itself just to learn more about the different houses and the different events that have happened through Westeros's history. The detail of the world itself is also amazing, all the different places are so gripping, with the mysteries that surround them. Things like the five forts and the oily black stone scattered around the world I am dying to get more info on them.

And a close second is how it portrays death and war. I've never seen a story where you truly see all of the suffering and the way it effects the people of the world. Instead of glorifying the war and having some hero who can slay a thousand people then talk about how great he is, you have people like Jon, and Brienne. Both great warriors, who hate killing, but do what has to be done. You can tell they have a respect for life, even those who didn't have respect for anybody else's. Also the '""broken man""ù speech is incredibly powerful.",SPOILER
"During Jon Snow's death scene in Season 5 I noticed something interesting : Olly didn't lie to Jon when he came to report the news about Uncle Benjen. Everything he told Jon was truth, but not in the way we think. 



He told Jon that '""One of the Wildlings you brought back (They think Jon is a traitor, so Jon is the ""òwildling' who came back,) Olly says this person knows your Uncle Benjen (True, Jon knows his own uncle obv), and Olly says that the wildling thinks Benjen is still alive (Jon hasn't accepted Benjen's death.) 


So Olly never lied to Jon, intentionally or not.",SPOILER
"Some of my favorite segments are:

Varamyr Sixskins chapter, specially the part where he describes his childhood and him gaining his skins, so to speak. 


There was no need to spend an entire chapter on a nobody like him. But here's the true strength of martin shines,  for me atleast,  world building by showing us characters instead of descriptions.  That prologue is haunting, yet very humanising, ironically.  Its the chapter, along with the prologue, I recommend to my friends who just don't get the value of reading books which already have  been adapted to a different medium.  Its impossible to convey the state of mind of varamyr  in a TV/ movie format without  monologuing and its where this series  really shines.  Getting into the heads of such unimportant characters, just for world building instead of action or plot. It kinda transcends the line between plot and becomes personal. 


Next would have to be the fever dreams of Bran and Jaime. Bran's in particular is just impossible to even imagine, really.  That falling sequence just fills me with feelings I can't even describe. 

 Also  that sequence where Jon teams up with Dalbridge. 




I don't think any other books have made me feels so unimaginative, except maybe  LOTR, dune, thousand years of solitude or anything Wodehouse. 




At are your favorite segments of the series?

"I've been catching up on [the January episode of Maester Monthly](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ahaao7/spoilers_extended_maester_monthly_e17_throw/) in which /u/JoeMagician, /u/glass_table_girl, and /u/Bookshelfstud discuss [\(Spoilers Published\) ""Guilty Feet Have Got No Rhythm"" A Critique on Martin's Writing of The Dance of Dragons](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a75sv9/spoilers_published_guilty_feet_have_got_no_rhythm/) by /u/Quackadeus (ok no more links). 

The critique is essentially that Martin wants us to see both sides of the Dance of the Dragons as bad but in fact writes the Greens (Aegon II's faction) as being way too evil, which makes clear that the reader should root for the Blacks (Rhaenyra's faction). I agree that that's the dynamic but this is leading me to a related criticism, focused on the main series.

There are two Big Things most readers and watchers take away from the War of Five Kings:

1. The Starks are the good guys.
2. War is hell.

There's more tension between those Things than GRRM really grapples with.

To be fair, GRRM shows us that plenty of bad or amoral people fight for the Starks, and their actions have unintended consequences that harm themselves and others. He even wrote AFFC, which is notorious to many fans for spending too much time dwelling on the hell of war rather than advancing previously established plot.

But **GRRM never really asks the reader to question the morality of Robb's decision to go to war**. He essentially takes for granted that the moral weight of the conflict falls on the people who created the casus belli. 


And sure, among all the Littlefinger-inspired events that lead to the WOFK, it is ultimately the Lannisters who cross the rubicon by murdering Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark, and laying siege to Riverrun. I agree that in the run-up to war, the Starks are the aggrieved party and the Lannisters are the aggressors.

But **Robb *did* have a choice. He could have chosen to eat shit and bend the knee to Joffrey. And he should have done so.**

In all the centuries of Westerosi history we've read, **we've never seen any Westerosi king make any policy change worth going to war over**. There's no slavery to abolish. Economic policy that actually affects the common people is barely mentioned. Social policy is mostly about keeping peace with the faith. In a society this primitive, the way GRRM writes it, the simple act keeping the peace is exponentially more important for the well-being of the common people than anything else the king or lords do or could do. And Robb failed to keep the peace.

(Note: that logic doesn't apply to the modern world, in which governments and their leaders and policies are far, far more relevant to their people's lives than they are in Westeros) 

Why? For honor? For vengeance? For Ned's memory? For Sansa's and Arya's freedom? What are those things against thousands of dead, broken, pillaged, and raped smallfolk, against the consequences for millions of civilians, against the famine and the winter and all the countless other Northern children who lost their fathers too?

Reasonable people can disagree about whether war is ever justified. I believe it can be. For example, Daenerys' war to free the slaves of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen is justified by the moral imperative of ending slavery. I'm not defending the chaos in the aftermath of that war or Dany's failure to foresee it, but I do believe ending slavery is a cause worth going to war over.

Sure, Joffrey was a terrible king and he would have continued to be""îunless someone poisoned him, and then Tommen would have been fine. A creature of the Lannisters, but what of it? What could they have done that would have caused harm anywhere in proportion to a massive civil war?

And sure, the Lannisters and Littlefinger and [Stannis](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7zhg63/spoilers_extended_everything_is_stannis_fault/) and Renly and the Tyrells all bear moral weight for the onset of war. At least as much as Robb, and probably much more (at least for the Lannisters and Littlefinger). But all of them, including Robb, are primary causes of the utter devastation of Westerosi society over a dispute that, if not for the war, wouldn't really affect the common people much.

Recall the legend of Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knealt. Rather than fight Aegon I's conquest, he bent the knee and saved countless lives from utter devastation. Characters in-universe argue about this, but to the reader it's presented as a difficult but noble act. And I think it was.

What's so different about Torrhen's situation and Robb's? Is it that Aegon the Dragon is remembered as a just and wise man, while the Lannisters are terrible? Is it that Aegon had never murdered a Stark? Is it that Aegon's quest for power was somehow more honorable than that of the Lannisters?

Think about it from Torrhen's perspective. He's not reading history written by the Targaryen winners centuries later. He doesn't know Aegon to be a wise and generous king whose dubious goal was to end war in Westeros by uniting all the quarreling lords under one rule. All Torrhen knows is that by the time he meets Aegon at the Trident, Aegon has subjugated or killed half the kings in the realm and their armies with fire and blood, using fearsome beasts never before seen in Westeros. To Torrhen, Aegon might as well have been the devil incarnate. And still he knealt.

Perhaps Torrhen knealt because he knew he couldn't win, and Robb fought because he thought he could. But in both cases, victory would not have been worth the cost of war. Because in both cases, the outcome had more to do with the Starks' power and respect than the good of their people. **The Targaryens and Lannisters were not the Whitewalkers, threatening total annihilation of all life if they won. Torrhen and Robb each faced a threat under which they would continue to rule the North mostly as they see fit, with all benefit they may provide to their people, save only a largely symbolic fealty to the Iron Throne. In these cases, and in the cases of every war between humans that we know of throughout the history of Westeros, fighting was not worth it.**

I say all this as a stan for the Starks and even for Robb in particular. They are in fact the (relative) good guys, the story demands that the war occur, and I even think [the Starks are better at the game of thrones than they get credit for being](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2z982m/spoilers_all_in_defense_of_ned_starks_talent_for/).

In fact, the Starks are much better heroes than the Blacks from the Dance. Quackadeus may be right that GRRM intended for us to hate both sides of that war, but he definitely doesn't want us to hate the Starks. George loves the Starks, and doesn't seem personally invested in any of the Dance characters as people. Rhaenyra has the better claim, and her supporters are less odious, but nobody comes out of that war looking good.

Robb died a hero; he never lived long enough to see himself become the villain. (What if Littlefinger is Harvey Dent? #WakeUpSheeple #nananananananana). But in a deeper way, all the nobles responsible for creating the war were, collectively, the villain. And the War Is Hell bits of AFFC might have hit harder if the author had the heart to make us see that, Red Wedding or no Red Wedding, our heroes bore significant responsibility for all that devastation""îor at least a huge fraction of it.

"White Walker description from a Game of Thrones (Book 1):

&#x200B;

*""The Others are tall and gaunt, with* ***flesh pale as milk***.""

&#x200B;

And then Maggy the Frog's prophecy about Cersei's death:

&#x200B;

*""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your* ***pale white throat*** *and choke the life from you.""*

&#x200B;

My theory is that she will die as a White Walker. As far as who the Valonqar is it could be Jaime who chokes her with his hands (possibly could have a dragonglass/obsidian hand or something).",SPOILER
"What if the Valonqar murdering her is an assumption?

Cersei is violent and would interpret the prophecy as predicting her murder.

What if she's pregnant with twins.  She has complications and the valonqar wrapping its hands around her neck is her youngest baby hugging her.  The whole life leaving her is her falling into despair over realizing she wasted her life being terrified of everything for no reason.

She dies from it because she might have been strong enough to survive normally but because of her state of mind she doesn't recover.

I don't think I've ever seen this theory before.  Please let me know if you think it's decent or if it's stupid.",SPOILER
"* Why did he do the things he did in ADwD? In terms of personal motivation and characterization, I don't see a natural, seamless progression from ASoS to ADwD for Mance. There seems to be a discontinuity. Without some further material and the expected payoff, I don't think Mance's survival is justified enough in the current books.

* Originally, the main goal of Mance was to lead his people to the safety of the south of the Wall. At the same time, he was not willing to sacrifice their freedom in the land of the '""kneelers""ù. That much he made it clear to Jon in their negotiation. But in ADwD, Mance seems to have let go this lifelong quest although a lot of his people are still in grave danger beyond the Wall. Moreover, his people who passed the Wall do not seem to have a bright future as well. 

* GRRM provides the reason why Mance is bothered to help them as 

> '""I had my doubts as well, Snow, but why not let her try? It was that, or let Stannis roast me.""ù

> '""Our false king has a prickly manner,""ù Melisandre told Jon Snow, '""but he will not betray you. We hold his son, remember. And he owes you his very life.""ù

* However, the Mance I knew was no craven and no kneeler. He would not be intimidated by death, which leaves the survival of his son as his only motivation. But how can he trust Mel with his son's life? Is he stupid enough to believe in Mel's words and promises? This might be yet another clue for Stannis being actually involved in the glamor switch. If Stannis swore to protect Mance's son for his obedience and services, Mance might have been inclined to agree. But then again, this meant Mance was foreswearing his lifelong mission of bringing his people to safety and preserving their freedom. Moreover, if Mance was going to kneel to Stannis like this, why did he not do that publicly and remove the necessity for glamor? Yet another discrepancy that needs to be addressed.

* Naturally, discrepancies like this draw lots of tinfoil as a corpse draws crows. Most readers instinctively realize that there must be additional material for all this to make sense. As a result, I think the TWoW twist GRRM came up with might be related to Mance in an attempt to provide him a more natural and organic motivation. Hopefully we will see if this is the case and how much he will succeed in justifying the survival of Mance.

* Finally, I want to talk about where this Mance problem comes from. I think before the 5 year gap was scrapped, Mance was destined to a far different route that was in line with his prior characterization. When that plan was scrapped, Mance became aimless. Below is my general sketch of the original plans for Mance:

1. fArya is introduced in ASoS and she is destined to Dreadfort.

1. Mance is secretly spared by Stannis/Mel just the same. 

1. Mance is given the mission to raid Dreadfort and kidnap fArya from there. Asha is also involved in this mission. Mance kidnaps fArya and Theon from Dreadfort. But he does not return to Stannis. He betrays him and kills Asha.
	
1. Mance flees to Hardhome to rally his people once again. This time, fArya is Mance's greatest leverage for the safety of his son and the terms he would require from Stannis/Northmen.

1. fArya as Mance's hostage fits well with the original 1993 outline idea of  Catelyn and her children falling into the hands of Mance Rayder. Then Hardhome is attacked and Mance somehow flees to Braavos with fArya and the other survivors. The Lyseni slaver ship that took women and children from Hardhome and ended up in Braavos might be a remnant of this plan.

1. In Braavos, instead of Dareon (who would have stayed at the Wall with Sam throughout the 5 year gap), Arya kills Mance and gets blinded for it. You should notice the similarity with Arya killing an oathbreaker crow who happens to be a very good singer and getting blinded for it. I think Dareon inherited this role from Mance.

1. fArya dedicates herself to the House of Black & White in return for revenge and Arya switches places with her. This way, you should notice the similarity with the origin story of the Waif. 

1. I think Justin Massey will eventually take fArya to Braavos and the merger of fArya and Arya will still take place. I think Justin Massey inherited this role from Mance and Arya will kill him too. There is very clear setup for Justin Massey betraying Stannis for fAegon or Dany and trying to claim fArya for himself. That should be the moment where Arya kills him.

"The similarities I see far. 

- Some families in the North want the Starks to return and some don't. Some families want the Targaryens to return and some don't. 

- The common folk reminisce that they had a good life under the Starks, the common folk reminisce that they had a good life under the Old King i.e. Aerys. 

- Both were displaced and if being removed from the power means the claim is gone, both don't have a right to claim the seat as theirs.

- Both seats are currently being held by the worst possible humans who care little for anything except power - Ramsay/Roose for Winterfell and Cersei for Iron Throne.

- In both cases, the father and elder brother are killed and the younger sibling is on a quest to reclaim the family seat.

Obviously it is an unpopular opinion since we are conditioned to see Starks as a good family, the fight for Winterfell as just (since it is Ned Stark's seat) and the fight for Iron Throne as unjust (since Ned Stark died in the fight for throne)",SPOILER
"At the end of A Dance with Dragons when Dany left Drogon and starts wandering around, she gets sick and experiences vaginal bleeding.  She seems to think it's menstruation, though she notes the timing is off.  She also can't seem to remember the last time she bled.

Reading this at the time, it struck me immediately that Dany must have been pregnant, and had just experienced a miscarriage.  This didn't really jump out at me at the time, but after all the discussion I've seen over the years: the child must have been Daario Naharis'.  Dany of course is disoriented by her circumstances, hunger, thirst, possible poisoning, and her point of view is cut off soon after.

Probably the most significant part of this is that Dany may be completely capable of conceiving a child, but the prophecy foresees her losing all her pregnancies  


EDIT: this post isn't really about whether Mirri Maz Duur's declaration to Dany is strictly a ""prophecy.""  That being said, it's a prophecy in the broad sense that it's a declaration about the future.  Most importantly, Dany believes it to be true and behaves as if it were true.  Sure you could argue that it's more of a ""curse"" that Mirri is casting on Dany, seeing her as an extension of the people that have ruined her life.  But in Martin's work I can't think of an example of a curse that wasn't brought up in the context of it being proven true later, therefore functioning effectively as a prophecy",SPOILER
Where is the line drawn on who you can and can't kill in your family? We know that siblings and parents are out of bounds. But what about aunts and uncles? With cousins are first cousins kin but second not? Are step-siblings kin?,SPOILER
"Of the many people Arya encounters in her journey from the Red Keep to Braavos, the most enigmatic, to my way of thinking, is the Lady of the Leaves.

>""What did the maester mean, about asking the Lady of the Leaves?""The archer smiled. ""Wait and see.""Three days later, as they rode through a yellow wood, Jack-Be-Lucky unslung his horn and blew a signal, a different one than before. The sounds had scarcely died away when rope ladders unrolled from the limbs of trees. ""Hobble the horses and up we go,"" said Tom, half singing the words. They climbed to a hidden village in the upper branches, a maze of rope walkways and little moss-covered houses concealed behind walls of red and gold, and were taken to the Lady of the Leaves, a stick-thin white-haired woman dressed in roughspun. ""We cannot stay here much longer, with autumn on us,"" she told them. ""A dozen wolves went down the Hayford road nine days past, hunting. If they'd chanced to look up they might have seen us.""""You've not seen Lord Beric?"" asked Tom Sevenstrings.""That's an old stale tale, and false,"" said Lem. ""The lightning lord's not so easy to kill. Ser Gregor might have put his eye out, but a man don't die o' that. Jack could tell you.""""Well, I never did,"" said one-eyed Jack-Be-Lucky. ""My father got himself good and hanged by Lord Piper's bailiff, my brother Wat got sent to the Wall, and the Lannisters killed my other brothers. An eye, that's nothing.""""You swear he's not dead?"" The woman clutched Lem's arm. ""Bless you, Lem, that's the best tidings we've had in half a year. May the Warrior defend him, and the red priest too.""

*A Storm of Swords* \- Arya IV

I'm surprised the Lady invokes the Warrior and the Red priest, but not the old gods.

Does anyone have any thoughts about this curious person?  

&#x200B;

Added-  

the comments of /u/Kodiak_Marmoset over at pure sparked these reflections of mine:

The Lady of the Leaves forms part of  a set of three older women associated with trees who offer shelter or help or information to Arya on her journey from the Red Keep to Braavos. 

**The Lady of the Leaves**   

She and her people literally live in the trees and offers Arya and party lodging for the night. Is she a call-out to Tolkien's Galadriel?   

**The Ghost of High Heart** 

The strange albino dwarf offers some the visions most easily verified by the reader. All she asks in return is to hear the same song, over and over again.  

**Lady Smallwood of Acorn Hall** 

This salty dame saucily claims to the parties of searching Northern soldiers that she has ser Jaime hidden in her bedchamber, offers Arya affectionate care and fresh clothes and also tells us about a daughter who has sent to Oldtown for safety :(

"I'm reading A Feast For Crows, and it's the flashback to Cersei meeting Maggy the Frog. Cersei asks if she and the king will have children. Maggy says yes, and that she will have three. But, Robert doesn't give her any children.

"""Aegon has been shaped for rule before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them.

"After reading another post, I thought I'd pose the question to the fandom: who are the enemies left before the Others take center stage?

I always saw Joffrey as the Act 1 villain, with Ramsay Bolton as our Act 2, and Euron as the Act 3 villain.  Littlefinger has been a continuous '""bad guy""ù from start to finish, but I don't know if I'd consider him in the same sense as the other 3.  Tywin was another one, kind of during the same time frame was Ramsay.

Is Euron the last evil character before we move to the final boss that are the Others, or does Littlefingers treachery come to the fore and become the Act 4 bad guy? Or am I missing someone else? 

Extra points to anyone that argues that Danny's return to Westeros is the Act 4 bad guy, at least from the perspective of the Westerosi.

Excited to get everyone's opinion.",SPOILER
"**Welcome to my *Secret History of House Martell* series: a revised, expanded iteration of my nutty ideas regarding all things Nymeros-Martell.**

This post is Chapter 2 in said series. You can also read this on my blog, here: https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/the-secret-history-of-house-martell-chapter-2/.

This post assumes familiarity with Chapter 1, although it doesn't entirely rely on it. In Chapter 1 (which you can read in 3 parts on reddit, [BEGINNING HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a412o1/spoilers_extended_the_secret_history_of_house/), or in one giant post on my blog [HERE](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2018/12/07/the-secret-history-of-house-martell-chapter-1-the-merry-elder-brothers-brother-marwyn-his-sand-snake-daughter-and-tyene-the-stalking-stork/)), I argued for the following propositions:

- Quiet Isle's Elder Brother is now in the Vale in the guise of Ser Morgarth the Merry, a hedge knight hired by (an unwitting) Littlefinger. He is likely seeking Sansa Stark in concert with ""Ser Shadrich"" and ""Ser Byron the Beautiful"". (I have elsewhere argued that Ser Shadrich is Howland Reed and that Ser Byron is Sandor Clegane glamored to look like the AWOL Tyrek Lannister""îwho is himself Quiet Isle's gravedigger.)

- The man known as both Elder Brother and Ser Morgarth is in fact Prince Lewyn Martell of Dorne, who is ""dead"" in the same sense Sandor Clegane is now ""dead"".
- Elder Brother/Ser Morgarth the Merry/Prince Lewyn Martell has an older brother: Archmaester Marywn ""The Mage"". Marwyn is thus uncle to Oberyn and Doran and is, like Lewyn, the younger brother of the nameless former ruling Princess of Dorne, who was mother to Doran, Elia, and Oberyn.
- Obara Sand is almost certainly not Oberyn's daughter but Marwyn's.
- Oberyn's daughter Tyene Sand is already in King's Landing in the guise of the pock-marked, storky novice appearing in ADWD's Epilogue. Some of the textual reasons to believe this dovetail with the idea that Elder Brother is Lewyn. (See: the storks living around Quiet Isle.)

Here in Chapter 2, I will argue for the following propositions (which I acknowledge will at first blush strike many folks as just as outlandish, clearly absurd, totally batshit crazy, and/or surely impossible to support with any textual evidence as the first batch did):

- The nameless former ruling Princess of Dorne""îmother of Doran, Oberyn and Elia Martell""îis an incredibly important character. She was a classic Dornish libertine, and her children were sired by three different men.

- Her second child, Elia, was sired by Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen, a few years before Jaehaerys was crowned Jaehaerys II.
- Her third child, Oberyn, was sired by Jaehaerys's son, Prince Aerys, a few years before Aerys was crowned Aerys II.
- The nameless former ruling Princess of Dorne is still alive. She did not die, but""îin keeping with the ""rhyme"" already established between history's King Charles I of Spain and the Martells""îabdicated and retired to a holy sanctuary, in part due to what was at the time crippling gout (like the gout that prompted Charles's abdication and retirement to a monastery).
- She is living in King's Landing as Septa Scolera in the company of none other than Septa Mordane, known as Septa Moelle, and Maege Mormont, known as Septa Unella.
- Scolera's gout is well-managed by her consumption of sour milk products""îthe single best thing a person with gout can consume.
- Scolera's true name is likely Sarella; Oberyn's daughter Sarella is likely her namesake.

#Oberyn and Elia: ""Martells"" Who Are Also Targaryen Bastards
I submit that in the mid-to-late 250s, Doran Martell's mother, the Princess of Dorne""îpossessed of freewheeling Dornish-Targaryen sexual mores""îbedded her older cousin Prince Jaehaerys, the future-King Jaehaerys II. Their coupling resulted in the birth of Elia Martell. Mere months after Elia's birth, the Princess of Dorne then bedded Jaehaerys's son, Prince Aerys, the future Mad King Aerys II, who thus sired Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper.

Why do I think all this? It's complicated.

##The Nine Year Gap
For the sake of brevity and simplicity, I'll call the nameless Martell Princess of Dorne who mothered Doran, Elia and Oberyn *""Scolera""*, because I'll later argue that she's *now* called ""Septa Scolera"". (Her true name is likely Sarella, but ""Scolera"" avoids confusion with Oberyn's daughter, her namesake, Sarella.)

Given that Oberyn refers to Scolera's consort *as* ""her consort"", per se, rather than ""my father"" *or* ""Elia's father""""î
>""It was when I visited Casterly Rock with my mother, **her consort**, and my sister Elia."" (SOS Ty V)

""îOberyn clearly believes he and Elia were sired by someone else. Regardless of whether Oberyn knows the truth, his words (a) foreground the question of his and Elia's paternity, and (b) hint that Scolera kept things fresh in her bedroom.

While less definitive, Oberyn's words to Tyrion""î
>""Why, if the gods were cruel, they would have made me **my mother's** firstborn, and Doran her third."" (SOS Ty V)

""îare certainly consistent with he and Doran having different fathers, in that they only stipulate their common *maternity.*

Now, we know that after Scolera gave birth to Doran, she failed to have any children who lived past infancy until nine *years* later, when Elia and Oberyn were born in quick succession, defying Doran's expectations:
>""I was the oldest,"" the prince [Doran] said, ""and yet I am the last. **After Mors and Olyvar died in their cradles, I gave up hope of brothers.** I was nine when Elia came, a squire in service at Salt Shore. When the raven arrived with word that my mother had been brought to bed a month too soon, I was old enough to understand that meant the child would not live. Even when Lord Gargalen told me that I had a sister, **I assured him that she must shortly die. Yet she lived, by the Mother's mercy. And a year later Oberyn arrived, squalling and kicking.**"" (FFC CotG)

Two successful pregnancies after nine spotlighted years of infertility and crib deaths hints that Scolera found herself a fresh sperm donor""îor two.

##Timeline Issues
Let's take a quick look at the relevant timeline. Per Chapter 1's discussion of Obara's paternity, it's likely Doran was born in late 247 or early January 248, with Oberyn born close to 10 ¬Ω years later, c. April-June 258. We know Doran ""was nine when Elia came"", and that ""a year later Oberyn arrived"". (FFC CotG) Since Oberyn was probably conceived c. July-August 257, this means Elia was likely born c. April-June 257 and conceived c. July-August 256 (although it's possible ""a year later"" rounded down the actual gap, meaning Elia was born/conceived 1-6 months earlier than that).

Aegon V/""Egg"" was king until 259 AC. His second son Jaehaerys was almost certainly born in 225 AC""îwe're told his age during three different years, all of which yield ""225"" by simple subtraction""îmaking him about 31 when Elia was conceived, which fits. (TWOIAF)

Jaehaerys's son Aerys was 18-years-old when he became king in 262, meaning he was born in either 243 or 244. Thus Aerys would have been at minimum an ""old"" 12 but more likely 13 if not 14 when Oberyn was conceived c. mid-to-late 257. If this seems ""too young"" to possibly bed the same woman his father bedded the year before, consider first that both parties were possessed of Targaryen blood, notorious for producing precocious sexuality. (Jaehaerys himself was only 14 or 15 when he eloped with his 13-14-year-old sister Shaera.) Moreover, and *not*, I think, coincidentally, we *know* that Oberyn himself was probably 11 or 12 when *his* supposed first bastard Obara Sand was conceived. If the world can believe Oberyn is her father, and if Aerys was almost certainly slightly older when Oberyn was conceived than Oberyn was when Obara was conceived, then obviously Aerys wasn't too young to sire Oberyn.

What about Scolera? Given (a) her own precocious Targaryen blood, (b) the cultural nature of Dornish sexuality (see below) and (c) the fact that she was still young enough to be a lady-in-waiting to Rhaella in 259 AC, when Joanna Lannister arrived""î
>""Lannisport was the end of our voyage,"" Prince Oberyn went on""¶. **""Were you aware that our mothers knew each other of old?""**

>**""They had been at court together as girls, I seem to recall. Companions to Princess Rhaella?""** [said Tyrion] (SOS Ty X)
***
>In 263 AC, after a year as the King's Hand, Ser Tywin married his beautiful young cousin **Joanna Lannister, who had come to King's Landing in 259 AC for the coronation of King Jaehaerys II and remained thereafter as a lady-in-waiting to Princess (later Queen) Rhaella.** (TWOIAF)

""îI find it overwhelmingly likely that Scolera was *very* young when she gave birth to Doran back in 247-248: probably 12-15, making her only 20-25 when Elia and Oberyn were conceived. (A 12-year-old gives birth in *Blood & Fire*.)

##The *Point* Of All That Targ & Dornish Smut
Let's assume Scolera was indeed 20-24 when Elia was conceived in 256. It's easy to imagine a 20-to-24-year-old culturally Dornish maternal Targaryen descendant of Daenerys Targaryen (and Mariah Martell) bedding a 30-year-old paternal Targaryen descendant of Daenerys's brother Daeron (and Mariah's brother Maron Martell) like Jaehaerys. But would the same woman then bed that man's *son*, a ""man"" roughly 9 years her junior, shortly after giving birth to said boy's half-sister? And would a 13 or 14-year-old Targaryen prince bed his older cousin mere months after she gave birth to the bastard daughter of his own father? Judging by everything we're told about Targaryen and Dornish sexual mores""îseemingly gratuitous details that now smell like clever foreshadowing""î*hell yes.*

Consider: The Targaryen drive to incest is drilled into us from the earliest moments of AGOT. Dany marries and begins enjoying sex at (supposedly) 13. Helaena Targaryen marries and conceives at 13. (tRP) Maegor the Cruel married and consummated at 13, Viserys II at 12 with a much-older bride of 19, who gave birth the following year! (F&B)

The Dornish, including Scolera's descendants, are similarly libidinal and precocious:
>It was said that [Oberyn] bedded men and women both""¶ (SOS Tyr V)
***
>[Tyrion:] ""Did you tire of your paramour on the road?""

>""Never. We share too much."" Prince Oberyn shrugged. ""We have never shared a beautiful blonde woman, however, and Ellaria is curious. Do you know of such a creature?"" (ibid)
***
>[Oberyn:] ""Her grace needs another husband, and who better than a prince of Dorne? Ellaria believes I should accept. Just the thought of Cersei in our bed makes her wet, the randy wench."" (SOS Tyr I)
***
>""I was abed with the Fowler twins when the word reached me,"" the captain heard [Nymeria Sand] say. (FFC CotG)
***
>**Dornish women were lewd**""¶ (DWD tW)
***
>""Are you certain you are not off to some other bed, some other woman? Tell me who she is. I will fight her for you, bare-breasted, knife to knife."" [Arianne] smiled. **""Unless she is a Sand Snake. If so, we can share you. I love my cousins well.""** (FFC tSK)
***
>""You need a woman, not a little girl, but I can play the innocent if that excites you.""

>""You should not say such things."" **Remember, she is Dornish**. In the Reach men said it was the food that made Dornishmen so hot-tempered and their **women so wild and wanton.** (tSK)
***
>**[Arianne] and Tyene** had learned to read together, learned to ride together, learned to dance together""¶ **They would have shared their first man as well**, but Drey got too excited and spurted all over Tyene's fingers the moment she drew him from his breeches. Her hands are dangerous. The memory made her smile. (FFC PitT)
***
>The Bastard of Godsgrace [Daemon Sand] was one of Dorne's finest swords as well, as might be expected from one who had been **Prince Oberyn's squire** and had received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself. Some said that **he had been her uncle's lover too**, though seldom to his face. Arianne did not know the truth of that. He had been her lover, though. **At fourteen she had given him her maidenhead.** Daemon had not been much older, so their couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent. (WOW Arianne I)

I believe the drumbeat regarding Arianne's precocious sexuality""î
>""The Bastard of Godsgrace had my maidenhead when **we were both fourteen**."" - Arianne (FFC tSK)

""îis intentional, hinting that her grandmother Scolera was quite young when she gave birth to Doran, meaning Scolera was still only 21-25 when Oberyn was conceived (and thus potentially *very* attractive to the then-pubescent Aerys).

Meanwhile, the fact that Daemon Sand was *also* 14 at the time means he was about 18 years younger than his *other* erstwhile lover, Oberyn. *That* relationship presumably began when Daemon was a young squire, much as Aerys was a young squire at the time Oberyn was conceived. Significantly, the age gap between Daemon and Oberyn *dwarfs* the probable gap between Princess Scolera and Prince Aerys. Could Oberyn's proclivity to ""bed with boys"" (as against ""men"") be a wink to his mother doing the same vis-a-vis Aerys? (SOS Jai VII)

We also see Oberyn's 14-year-old daughter Elia Sand make out with Feathers, who is ""twice [her] age"". We know Elia Sand is 14, and thus that Feathers is around 28, because GRRM *again* reminds us of Arianne's sexual precocity:
>It did not escape the princess that **Elia was the same age she had been when she gave her maidenhead to Daemon Sand.** (WOW Arianne II)

It's almost as if Martell women's interest in sex at an early age might somehow be relevant to our story, which it is *if* I'm right and Scolera was very young when she became pregnant with Doran and thus was still young enough to be of interest to Aerys when Oberyn was sired. Meanwhile, the age gap between Feathers and Elia is much larger than the age gap between Scolera and either of her putative princely paramours (including the *other* Elia's father).

Speaking of age gaps, when Oberyn recounts Scolera and Joanna Lannister's supposed plot to marry their children to one another, Oberyn conspicuously implies that Scolera had no problems with the age differences""î
>""Elia and I were older, to be sure. Your brother and sister could not have been more than eight or nine. **Still, a difference of five or six years is little enough.**"" (SOS Ty X)

""î*even as he drastically understates the age gaps, thus staying readers' alarm bells.* In truth, Cersei and Jaime were born in 266. Thus Elia, who was likely born in late 256/early 257, was actually about *nine* years older than her would-be husband Jaime, which just so happens to be the age gap *between Aerys and Scolera,* assuming Scolera was 13 when she had Doran c. very late 247.

*Fire & Blood* contains several fresh instances of older women bedding much younger men. Especially relevant to our hypotheses, 19-year-old Larra Rogare was impregnated by a 12-year-old Targaryen prince who later became king, and 19-year-old Prince Aemond Targaryen was seduced by and impregnated Alys Rivers, who was""¶
>twice his age (thrice, if we put our trust in Mushroom). (F&B 460)

Two more details from *F&B* are just as pertinent to our hypotheses. First, we learn of a young lord who *took his own father's widow (who was older than him and with whom he had long been infatuated) as his paramour*, fathering children on her and eventually marrying her. (FB 581-582) In comparison, the idea that Aerys merely *bedded* his father's *paramour* seems tame.

Second, we read about a ruling Princess of Dorne who took one look at the Valyrian-blooded ""dragonseed"" Alyn Velaryon and decided she *must* have him, despite his famous marriage to a Targaryen princess:
>Lord Alyn required fresh water and provisions for his ships, whilst **Princess Aliandra required services of a more intimate nature.** ""¶ the attentions the flirtatious Dornish princess lavished upon him much displeased her own lords, and angered her younger siblings""¶(F&B 652)

I suspect Aliandra's descendant Princess Scolera had similar ""requirements"" of Jaehaerys and/or Aerys, and given everything we've said about Dornish and Targaryen sexuality, it's unlikely a Targaryen-blooded Dornishwoman like Scolera would have had misgivings about bedding and having the children of first a married Targaryen father and later his betrothed son. After all""¶
>""Even death is not sacred to a Dornishmen."" (DWD tW)

In sum, Targaryens and Martells (with their Targ blood) fuck young, and they fuck much older/younger people, often and with relish. (Regarding the allusions to the Martells having same-sex sex partners, this suggests there may have been a sexual aspect to Scolera and Joanna's friendship, to be discussed later.)

##Aerys: A Charming, Handsome Youth
Even if Aerys's age was no issue, why would Scolera want to sleep with him, specifically? A look at the young Aerys answers that question *and* shows that much of what we're told about him comports perfectly with him siring Oberyn.

First, Aerys is Targaryen; Scolera's Targ blood would find that inherently attractive. Blood aside, TWOIAF makes it clear that the young Aerys was a tasty dish, nothing like the unkempt man he became. At the time of his ascension to the throne in 262, Aerys was ""a handsome youth"". Selmy calls him ""charming and generous."" (SOS Dae VI) TWOAIF agrees:
>[Aerys] had an undeniable charm that won him many friends.

A few years after Oberyn was conceived, Aerys ""fought gallantly in the Stepstones during the War of the Ninepenny Kings"" and ""won his spurs"" at 16. (TWOIAF) Surely something of his physical quality was manifest a few years earlier. Who wouldn't like this guy?
>The young king was **lively and active** in the early years of his reign. He loved **music, dancing**, and masked balls""¶ (TWOIAF)

Notice that Aerys's love of music and dance is mirrored by Oberyn, who Ellaria Sand says wrote her songs""î
>""Will [vengeance] make me laugh, **write me songs**, care for me when I am old and sick?"" (DWD tW)

""îand who is noted as dancing at Harrenhal. (He's Meera's ""red snake""). (SOS B II) (I cannot confirm whether Oberyn enjoyed masked balls.)

Aerys's plethora of mistresses""î
>Some say he had as many mistresses as his ancestor Aegon the Unworthy""¶. Unlike Aegon IV, however, Aerys II always seemed to lose interest in his lovers quickly. Many lasted no longer than a fortnight and few as long as half a year. (TWOIAF)

""îdoesn't hurt the idea that he was attractive. It's also remarkably reminiscent of Oberyn, who has a large brood of bastards by different women (including a few we haven't been told about whom I will discuss in future Chapters.)

Scolera was likely Aerys's first lover, and I believe he maintained an abiding interest in her (as he did in Scolera's friend Joanna Lannister), belying his fickle tendencies. Thus Aerys's trip to Dorne in 270 makes perfect sense as a visit to his erstwhile lover and their son, Oberyn. Reunited (and perhaps quietly proud of the fierce young man Oberyn was becoming), Aerys promised Scolera the moon, as men will do:
>His Grace was full of grand schemes""¶ [Four such ""schemes"" are described, then""¶] In 270 AC, during a visit to Sunspear, he told the Princess of Dorne that he would ""**make the Dornish deserts bloom**"" by digging a great underground canal beneath the mountains to bring water down from the rainwood.

>None of these grandiose plans ever came to fruition; most, indeed, were forgotten within a moon's turn, for **Aerys II seemed to grow bored with his royal enthusiasms as quickly as he did his royal paramours.** (TWOIAF)

Two things to notice (for the present purpose, anyway): First, the project of making a desert bloom is a blatant metaphor for getting someone pregnant who previously had difficultly conceiving, as was the case with Scolera prior to Elia's conception. That talk of digging a canal doesn't hurt. (""Laying pipe"", anyone?) Nor does the remark about plans failing to come to ""fruition"", often ""within a moon's turn"". (Conception and menstrual cycles, anyone?)

Second, GRRM chooses to casually mention Aerys's many paramours *immediately* after bringing up his trip to Dorne and his promise to the Princess of Dorne, who I believe was one such paramour.

While Aerys's grandiose, quickly abandoned plans may evidence his ""vain, proud, and changeable"" nature, ""these flaws were not immediately apparent to most at the time of his ascension,"" and were surely even less apparent (to Scolera) a few years earlier, when Oberyn was conceived. (TWOIAF)

Eventually, of course, Scolera came to realize what Aerys became. Thus her knowing comments to Doran about ""madmen"":
>""My mother taught me long ago that only madmen fight wars they cannot win."" - Doran Martell (FFC tSK)

##Like Father, Like Son?
Compare the foregoing portrait of the young Aerys with our introduction to Oberyn Martell, who is a renaissance man, or, uncharitably, a dilettante:
>[Oberyn] had traveled in the Free Cities, learning the poisoner's trade and perhaps arts darker still, if rumors could be believed. He had studied at the Citadel, going so far as to forge six links of a maester's chain **before he grew bored.** He had soldiered in the Disputed Lands across the narrow sea, riding with the Second Sons for a time before forming his own company. His tourneys, his battles, his duels, his horses, his carnality""¶ it was said that he bedded men and women both, and had begotten bastard girls all over Dorne. (SOS Tyr V)

Oberyn's dilettantish tendencies""îhe dabbles at being a maester, soldier, tourney knight, lover, songwriter""îand his ""unpredictable"" nature are strikingly reminiscent of Aerys II's ""changeable"" nature, ""endless caprices"" and ""grand schemes"". (DWD tW) We're told verbatim that Oberyn *""grew bored""* of his studies, just as Aerys *""seemed to grow bored""* after initial enthusiasm for new endeavors. Like father, like son.

Oberyn's success as a soldier mirrors Aerys's, who as mentioned ""fought gallantly"" during the War of the Ninepenny Kings.

Both men guzzle wine. Aerys ""drank too much wine"" at Tywin's wedding and was ""very much in his cups"" at the Anniversary Tourney of 272. (DWD Dae VII; TWOIAF) Oberyn complains that Tyrion's wine isn't strong enough (Tyrion IX) and even drinks before dueling The Mountain, saying:
>""I always drink before battle."" (SOS Tyr X)

While Oberyn's wine-swilling jibes with Doran's and Quentyn's wine-savoring, Elder Brother Lewyn's (former) alcoholism and red, veiny nose, and Marwyn's sourleaf habit, what about the capacity for moderation evinced by Doran, Quentyn and Lewyn? Marwyn might chew sourleaf, but at least he's dry. Oberyn's immoderation thus makes even *more* sense if he's Aerys's son.

Both Oberyn and Aerys are laughers and japers. Oberyn laughs every time we see him, including in Arianne's memory, and has been a japer since he dubbed Baelor Hightower ""Breakwind"". (SOS Ty V, IX, X; FFC tCoG) Ellaria even references Oberyn making her laugh. (DWD tW) Notwithstanding the bias of our sources, we're repeatedly told of Aerys japing and laughing:
>Lord Rykker said, ""If we need gold, His Grace should sit Lord Tywin on his chamber pot."" **Aerys and his lickspittles laughed loudly**, whilst Father stared at Rykker over his wine cup. (FFC C II)
***
>The king replaced him as Hand with Lord Owen Merryweather, an aged and amiable lickspittle famed for laughing loudest at **every jape and witticism uttered by the king**, no matter how feeble. (TWOIAF)

Aerys's tendency toward levity is again implied in a passage which contrasts Aerys with Tywin:
>[T]he King's Hand was **all that the king himself was not**""îdiligent, decisive, tireless, fiercely intelligent, just, and **stern**. (TWOIAF)

Tywin actually draws a curiously similar (if implicit) contrast between (Aerys's son) Oberyn and Doran, just before his words (probably unwittingly) betray the truth of Oberyn's paternity:
>""Prince Oberyn's presence here is unfortunate. His brother is a cautious man, a reasoned man, subtle, deliberate, even indolent to a degree. He is a man who weighs the consequences of every word and every action. **But Oberyn has always been half-mad.**"" (SOS Ty VI)

Doesn't it make *perfect* literary sense that the bastard son of the ""Mad King"" would be casually referred to as ""*half*-mad""?

Notice that Doran's caution and deliberation don't just set him apart from Oberyn, as Tywin implies. Deliberate, reasoned Doran is equally the opposite of the changeable, capricious Aerys, which makes sense if Aerys is Doran's opposite number Oberyn's father. Of particular note: Doran is oddly called ""indolent""""îmeaning lazy or ""inactive""""îin contrast to (his opposite number Oberyn's father) Aerys being called ""lively and active"".

##Oberyn and Aerys's *Other* Son, Rhaegar
Oberyn's aptitude for scholarship may at first seem to belie his paternity: Aerys was ""not""¶ the most intelligent"" prince. (TWOIAF) But remember, Aerys's son Rhaegar was clearly intelligent:
>""As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault."" (SOS Dae I)

What we know of Rhaegar's looks suggests a close relationship between him (and thus his father Aerys) and Oberyn that's not shared by the other Martells.

Dany sees Rhaegar as distinctly ""taller"" than Viserys. (COK Daen IV) She calls Rhaegar ""a fierce warrior"". (GOT D V) Rhaegar thus being a tall, ""fierce warrior"" sounds much like Oberyn, who is ""fierce"", ""tall, slim and graceful,"" ""slender"" and ""fit"". (SOS Tyr V, IX) Equally important: Oberyn's physique has almost nothing in common with Quentyn's, Marwyn's, Morgarth/Elder Brother Lewyn's or, implicitly, Doran's.

In Dany's House of the Undying vision, Elia is holding baby Aegon and asks Rhaegar,
>""Will you make a song for him?

""¶which echoes Ellaria's lament that Oberyn can no longer ""write me songs"".

Rhaegar's music-making fingers""î
>Many a night [Cersei] had watched Prince Rhaegar in the hall, playing his silver-stringed harp with those **long, elegant fingers** of his.""¶

""îsound like Oberyn's notably ""slender hand[s]"", which are nothing like Doran's, Lewyn's, or Marwyn's giant, gnarled, knuckly ham hands. (SOS Tyr V) Oberyn's ""slender hands"" have only one verbatim match in the canon: Melisandre""î
>She clasped the bars of his cell with her **slender white hands.** (SOS Dav III)

""îwho many believe is (also) a Targaryen bastard, Shiera Seastar, or Shiera's daughter. And if you believe Cersei is (also) Aerys's child, it must be said that hers are the only ""slender"" *fingers* in ASOIAF:
>""¶Cersei Lannister did not cry out. Her **slender fingers** brushed her cheek, where the pale smooth skin was already reddening. (GOT E X)

##Saturnine
Tyrion calls Oberyn's face ""saturnine"":
>The princeling removed his helm. Beneath, his face was lined and **saturnine**, with thin arched brows above large eyes as black and shiny as pools of coal oil. (SOS Ty V)

Saturnine means having qualities which were attributed in the middle ages to the planet Saturn: gloomy, cold, brooding, morose and remote. This is fascinating for two reasons. First, Saturn was thought to have these qualities in part because it was believed to be the furthest planet from the sun, which is the Martells' sigil. Is it thus hinted that Oberyn isn't *just* a Martell?

Second, who does ""gloomy, cold, brooding, morose and remote"" sound like to you? How about *this guy*:
>""But **I am not certain it was in Rhaegar to be happy.**""

>""You make him sound so sour,"" Dany protested.

>""Not sour, no, but . . . **there was a melancholy to Prince Rhaegar**, a sense . . ."" The old man hesitated again.

>""Say it,"" she urged. **""A sense . . . ?""**

>**"". . . of doom. He was born in grief, my queen, and that shadow hung over him all his days.""** (SOS Dae IV)

Selmy all but calls Aerys's (other) son Rhaegar ""saturnine"".

##Oberyn's Targaryen Eyes
Cersei remembers Rhaegar's eyes in liquid terms:
>**Cersei had almost drowned in the depths** of his sad purple eyes. (FFC C V)

Oberyn's eyes""î
>large eyes as black and shiny as **pools of coal oil.** (SOS Tyr V)

""îare clearly liquid as well. Lest we doubt, the only other reference in the canon to ""coal oil"" spells this out:
>The bird's black plumage shone like **coal oil** in the torchlight. **Wet**, Theon realized. (DWD Th I)

One could drown in ""*pools* of coal oil"", right? ""Coal oil"" is a notably flammable liquid, and Dany envisions Rhaegar's eyes aflame:
>And saw her brother Rhaegar, mounted on a stallion as black as his armor. **Fire glimmered red through the narrow eye slit of his helm.** (GOT Dae IX)

Oberyn's liquid eyes are not found among the Martells that aren't his daughters. We're indirectly told as much when we meet his daughter Tyene:
>Her hair was gold as well, and **her eyes were deep blue pools . . . and yet somehow they reminded the captain of her father's eyes, though Oberyn's had been as black as night. All of Prince Oberyn's daughters have his viper eyes, Hotah realized suddenly. The color does not matter.** (FFC CotG)

Notice that it's *only* the color that ""does not matter"" to the viper-quality. Tyene's ""viper"" eyes are thus logically characterized precisely by their Rhaegar-like depth (""deep"") and liquidity (""pools"")""îqualities also present in dragons' eyes. For example:
>[Viserion's] eyes were lakes of molten gold""¶ (DWD tDT)

It also matters that Oberyn has ""large eyes"". While Tyrion calls him ""a salty Dornishmen for certain"", Oberyn's large eyes fly in the face of (a) stereotypes""î
>She had always heard that Dornishmen were small and swarthy, with black hair and **small black eyes**""¶ (SOS Ty V, A VIII)

""î(b) Uthor-the-Martell-signpost's small black eyes and (c) Arys Oakheart's impressions after hanging around Doran's court:
>[Arys] could feel eyes upon him everywhere he went, **small black Dornish eyes** regarding him with thinly veiled hostility. (FFC tSK)

Large eyes are, however, *typical of recent Targaryens.* Aerys and Rhaegar share a gene pool with Egg's son Jaehaerys (given two generations of sibling incest), and Jaehaerys's eyes are ""very large"". (SSM Targaryen Kings) Jaime says Aerys's eyes were ""huge"" when he killed him:
>Those purple eyes grew **huge** then""¶ (SOS Jai II)

Oberyn's ""large"" eyes are also tagged as *""dark""*""î
>**The prince's eyes were dark** with amusement. (SOS Ty IX)

""îthus textually matching Egg's ""eyes large and dark"" as seen in *The Sworn Sword*. Elsewhere, Egg's eyes are called ""deep""""îlike Tyene's""î*and* ""dark"", like Oberyn's:
>In the dimness of the lamplit cellar **they looked black**, but in better light their true color could be seen: **deep and dark** and purple. Valyrian eyes, thought Dunk. (tSS)

Rhaegar's eyes are ""*dark* indigo"" and Aerys has ""dark eyes"" like Oberyn, too""î
>Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes, an old man with **dark eyes and long silver-grey hair.** (COK Dae IV)

""îwhile Aerys's ""silver-grey"" hair matches the ""streaks of silver"" in Oberyn's hair:
>Only **a few streaks of silver marred the lustrous black hair** that receded from [Oberyn's] brow in a widow's peak""¶ (SOS Ty V)

Note that the black color of Oberyn's eyes and (the rest of his) hair doesn't mean Aerys didn't sire him. Baelor Breakspear, who was the son of a purple-eyed, silver-gold-haired Targaryen king *and Mariah Martell,* had neither purple eyes nor metallic hair, but rather the ""dark hair and eyes"" of his Martell mother. (SSM Targaryen Kings;  tHK; TWOIAF) Bittersteel was likewise the *black-haired* son of a silver-gold-haired Targaryen king. (SSM The Great Bastards, Targaryen Kings)

##Sexy Rhaegar
Rhaegar's overwhelming sex appeal, especially to young Cersei""î
>Had any man ever been so beautiful? He was more than a man, though. His blood was the blood of old Valyria, the blood of dragons and gods""¶

>When she had been presented to him, Cersei had almost drowned in the depths of his sad purple eyes. He has been wounded, she recalled thinking, but I will mend his hurt when we are wed. Next to Rhaegar, even her beautiful Jaime had seemed no more than a callow boy. (FFC C V)

""îmatches Oberyn's, who not only scatters bastards about the world but was analogously extremely attractive to Arianne when she was yet a girl:
>""And what did you do, princess?"" asked Spotted Sylva.

>***I sat beside the well and pretended that some robber knight had brought me here to have his way with me,* [Arianne] thought, *a tall hard man with black eyes and a widow's peak*.** The memory made her uneasy. ""I dreamed,"" she said, ""and when the sun went down **I sat cross-legged at my uncle's feet** and begged him",SPOILER
"A Storm Of Swords, Tyrion III: '""He could think of nothing he would enjoy more, except perhaps strangling Cersei.""ù  This is where Tyrion offers to attack the Vale. I believe this hints at Tyrion being the Valonqar after all.

"Hanging around on a mailing list for Raymond Feist's books, I just now saw a post where he said his publishers decided to push his next book to a 2020 release instead of fall 2019.

As his books target at least partly the same audience, could this be a [hint](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/131/758/79b.jpg)?",SPOILER
"So this has undoubtedly been discussed at length before, but I'm not aware of any widely known theories. What I'm talking about is this: when discussing Arya's time in the House of Black and White, people understandably tend to focus on the Faceless Men's (ulterior) motives, their philosophy etc., and whether Arya will eventually embrace being 'No one' or if her Stark identity will prevail. Strangely enough, the underlying assumption generally seems to be that the FM do indeed want her to be no one. Now, yes, there are theories about the FM: Jaqen being in Oldtown; Valyria, dragons, slaves. However, whatever merit there might be in this, it does not quite explain what they need Arya for. Matter of fact, why recruit Arya in the first place. Of course, the answer might be simple: Jaqen was grateful for saving his life and impressed with her cleverness, realized she had nowhere to go and therefore gave her the coin. Maybe he had a gut feeling and made an executive decision. Whatever the case, after she initiates her training, it quickly becomes obvious that she is far from no one. She's struggled with her identity her whole life, challenging gender norms. She's got a list of people that she wants to kill for very personal reasons. She watched her father get beheaded and was pretty much there when her mother and brother were slaughtered. She's obviously deeply traumatized. In other words: she's got baggage. Furthermore, their philosophy doesn't sit well with her: some people deserve to die, others not so much. She's got a pretty clear sense of justice: that's why she kills Dareon, mirroring Gared's execution in AGOT. Of course, Arya's idea of justice is more personal than her father's, which is more abstract: Dareon betrayed Jon. He (or she) who passes the sentence must swing the sword, however, which is the opposite of the FM's MO. It's not coincidental that Ilyn Payne is on her list, even though she is herself being trained to be an executioner of sorts. And yet despite all this, they are extremely patient with her, even when 'Arya Stark' seems to get stronger. Of course, this is a pattern for her: the more people try to force her into an assigned role, the more she resists. But why are they so invested in Arya, specifically, when she's such a terrible fit in almost every aspect? There should be plenty of poor orphans without any clear sense of identity or family: Varys' little birds and the Unsullied prove as much. 

So, my question is: why Arya Stark? ",SPOILER
Would it have been such a hardship to just check the previous audio books for some semblance of continuity? Arya went from a sounding like a sullen little northern girl to an Irish fishwife. Previously Tywin went from Welsh to Winston Churchill,SPOILER
"When Ned returned to King's Landing after the Tower of Joy, he presented the news of Lyanna's death to Robert and the two recouncilled after their falling out on the subject of Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys's deaths. At that point Ned brought with him Jon Snow, apparently Robert was ok with the idea of the babe being Eddard's but what do you think Jon Arryn thoughts were on the situation ?

Jon Arryn is a smart guy and at that point one of the 4 people alive who knew Ned very well (Benjen Stark, Howland Reed, Robert Baratheon and Jon). Plus Ned named ""his bastard"" after Jon Arryn, so I figure he got to have an opinion on the baby. No ?",SPOILER
"Although Arya Stark is a fan-favorite character, from the second book onwards her story has only been tangentially involved in the ""main"" storyline apart from some brilliant foreshadowings and easter eggs which can be noticed in rereads (eg: Roose's treachery). Until Brienne in AFFC, Arya has been our 'smallfolk PoV', showing how the high lords' game of thrones  affects common people. And while I (and many others) love the world-building and mysteries associated with Braavos, some readers are bored with the storyline that seemingly goes nowhere. Here is an attempt to list theorized future directions for Arya Stark's story. Kindly add your own or other theories in the comments.

**I. Arya pretending to be ""Arya""**: This is the most probable storyline. We have Justin Massey headed to Braavos with Jeyne Poole who is pretending to be Arya Stark. It is assumed that in Braavos, Jeyne will die and Arya will take her face and/or place to return to Westeros. Arya is currently in the care of the House of Black and White, and there are hints in Fire&Blood that the Facelessmen, Iron Bank and the Sealord of Braavos are working in cooperation[a]. With the Iron Bank supporting Stannis and Jon Snow, Arya Stark's return to Westeros sponsored by Braavos is not unlikely. 

Problems with the theory:

* Justin Massey is supposed to leave Arya with Jon Snow, and if Jon is resurrected by the time he reaches the Wall, he will spot the imposter at once. 
* Even if he reaches Braavos unspoiled, Justin Massey is not allowed to return until he has 20,000 sellswords which is a very difficult task to achieve (with the Golden Company supporting Aegon, and most other sellsword companies engaged in Slaver's Bay). 
* Justin Massey is nowhere as iron-willed as the king he serves, and is prone to distractions (especially women). His loyalty to what *he thinks* a lost cause is very much in doubt. 

 Despite these obstacles on the way, I think it is still plausible for Arya to meet Massey and join his entourage one way or other.  

**II. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy**: The only released Arya chapter from TWOW was described as a beginning by Martin. In this chapter, we see Arya interacting with Lannister envoys from Westeros. In killing Raff, she has also disobeyed her instruction from HoB&W. She thinks she will miss Mercy, so clearly her role as Mercy is done, although we don't know what her actual objective at Izembaro's troupe was. Whatever that may be, killing Raff was personal, not instructed by FM. One could argue that she was asked to create problems that would disrupt the envoy's relationship with Braavosi nobility and ensuring Tommen did not receive the financial support he needed ( and that would be used against Iron Bank's own king candidate, Stannis). But I doubt Raff dying will affect anything. Men getting killed by whores is not unheard of in Braavos (in Happy Port there is already a whore who kills and robs the men she beds). And Harys Swyft is not the sort of man to care what happened to one of his lowborn guards. So what next for Arya? The show had her returning to Westeros to fulfill her revenge before going home to Winterfell. If Arya decided to run away from Braavos, the ship taking Lannister envoy back would be a good choice, because it will take her to Cersei, one of the earliest names in her list. 

Problems with the theory:

 * Jaime, not Arya is supposed to be the valonqar who kills Cersei. Arya finishing off Cersei soon after Swyft reaches KL could also remove a lot of other interesting storylines - the mad queen, wildfire plot, Cersei/Dany meeting, Cersei/Aegon, etc. 
 * The Facelessmen will not be easily subdued as it happened in the show. They have their own plans for Arya Stark, and Arya running off to kill Cersei may interfere with that. 
 * Arya will need her own face (and not Mercy's) before she runs away. For that she needs to go back to HoB&W and as said above, they may not be too willing to have her leave.

**III. I See You, Wolf Child, Death Child**: Irrespective of how she does it, if Arya leaves Braavos, the best place for her to resurface in Westeros is Riverlands. One of the strongest factors that pulls her back to Westeros and her identity as Arya Stark, is her wolf-dreams. And Nymeria is currently in Riverlands. (Yes, she sees snow which hints she is heading North, but it was snowing Riverlands in the last Jaime chapter of AFFC). There are too many people from Arya's past in Riverlands. Her 'pack' - Gendry and Hot Pie, the Brotherhood, the Hound, the uncle she tried to find (Brynden Blackfish), and most importantly her mother, Lady Stoneheart. It was Arya warging into Nymeria that pulled Lady Catelyn out of the river and onto the bank, that led Beric to find her. It was his promise to Arya Stark, that he will return her to her mother's arms that probably motivated Beric to give the kiss of life to Catelyn in such a hopeless situation. How Arya will react to her mother will also present an interesting conflict in both their stories. 

Problems with the theory:

 * The 'how' and 'when' of it. How will Arya reach Riverlands? How will it tie in with other major storylines? Jaime, Brienne, and Brotherhood situation is expected to reach an immediate conclusion in TWOW, with Jeyne Westerling appearing in the Prologue.
 * Maybe Nymeria is indeed heading North, to Winterfell. 
 
**IV. The Titan's Daughter**: We don't know how the Braavos storyline, which was giver richer details in the Mercy sample chapter will evolve, and what its significance will be in the main story. There are several ways it could be expanded, and Arya is the best PoV for that purpose, being already an acolyte at the HoB&W. The Braavosi storylines I hope to see explored in TWOW are: 

 * The Sealord Election, past and present: what happened with the Sealord who supported Dany and Viserys, whom did Syrio serve as First Sword

 * The keyholders 
 * The courtesans, especially the Black Pearl who has dragon-blood in her. 
 * Why the FM needs someone inside the Citadel (Alchemist)
 * Are there lemon-trees (at least a single tree in a greenhouse) in Braavos? Where is the house with the red door? 
 * Does the FM know about Arya's skinchanging abilities? What is their plan with her?
 * Why on earth are the Iron Bank helping Jon and the Wall? 

Problems with this storyline:

 * In my opinion, Arya's story is always about a child returning home. The more she tries to shed her identity as Arya Stark, the stronger she returns to being Arya Stark. 

**V. I want to see a Dragon**: Like the 4th point, this is a possibility rather than a theory. Given how Arya's story so far has her wandering from Winterfell to KL to Riverlands to Braavos, we shouldn't be surprised if Martin sends her to Volantis or Pentos where she could interact with our Essos set of characters, such as Dany, Tyrion, or Illyrio. Arya has heard Illyrio's voice before, and it would be nice for her to find out who the wizard was. 

[a]. In Fire&Blood, the Sealord purchases three dragon eggs from Elissa Farmen. When Septon Barth asks it back with threats of war, the Sealord replies with the threat of using Facelessmen against the Iron Throne. Then he arranges the Iron Bank to forego the loans given to the Iron Throne.

R'HOLLOR demands burning of men. Maybe the great other is somehow related to wolves. So many stories related to starks and the all and walkers. Why is the stark sigil a wolf? Who sent the direwolves? Maybe the starks of old worshipped the great other. ",SPOILER

"I'm posting after rewatching Bran giving the Valerian dagger to Arya in season 7 episode 4, and them commenting (once more) on whoever the orchestrator was, they were rich. 

But as far as killing a crippled child, any kind of blade would do. Why use this exotic one, risking the reveal that you're loaded, should the plot fail ? 

So this is were the [SPOILER IDK]* comes in. It has to do with the theory that Bran could be more than just the Three-Eyed-Raven. 

I've seen theories about him being the original Bran the Builder or the Night King, but I feel like a lot has to be done to explain how that came to be. 

A possible hook from GRRM could potentially be the ""intentional"" use of that Valerian blade (known to kill mythical beings, such as White Walkers) in the early assassination attempt of Bran Stark, to potentially prevent whatever he could later become ?

I'm also new to Reddit, so please point me in the right direction if this topic has already been discussed.

If there is a reason Benjen was sent to the wall, rather than willingly taking the black, Ned could have still taken responsibility of Jon just as easily as saying Benjen fathered Jon on a whore.  Although he was the youngest, he's only a year younger than Lyanna, and 15 is old enough to make babies.

Although he would still be a bastard at Winterfell, it would have eased much tension in the Stark household. 
Catelyn wouldn't have been such an evil bitch to Jon and Ned. Jon would have been so far down in line to take over house Stark, she wouldn't have to worry about her offspring inheriting.
Ned could have kept his honorable aura about him.

"I know GRRM has commented on being a fan of Lord of the Rings, but I don't recall him mentioning Narnia. Yet, there's a lot of similarities between the two worlds, mostly dealing with the far North.

In GoT, we have a Land of Always Winter. In Narnia, Jadis (the white witch) has turned the land into an endless winter, know as ""always winter, never Christmas."" In Westeros, I don't recall there being any holidays (other than name day celebrations).

The White Walkers are created somewhat on accident by the Children of the Forest (created on purpose, but then spun out of their control). Jadis was imprisoned on Charn and then brought to Narnia somewhat on accident by children who took her to the Woods Between Worlds. They were trying to get her away from Earth, took her to the woods, and then she ended up in Narnia. In both cases, a great winter-bringing evil accidentally let loose by the kids of the woods.

When the White Walkers were first made, they were defeated, the wall went up, and they were basically exiled to the North where they stayed for 8,000 years before heading South to conquer the world. When Jadis arrives in Narnia, she is banished by Aslan to the North where she stays for 900 years before heading South to conquer the world.

The White Walkers are out to kill the Children of the Forest and presumably their Weirwood tree network as well. Jadis brings winter to Narnia in part to kill the silver apple trees, which are the tree of knowledge.

Jadis is eventually defeated by an army led by the recently resurrected Aslan. The recently resurrected Jon Snow is likely to lead the army that defeats the Night King.

And now here's the kicker: There's a folk tale in GoT that the world exists inside the eye of a giant. Jadis is descended from Giants. She's also never completely destroyed. She came to Narnia with immense power (enough to destroy all life in a world with a single world), then spent another millennium increasing her powers in Narnia. **GoT takes place within the eye/mind of the defeated Jadis confirmed.** Get hype.",SPOILER
"After reading the '""The Great Theory of the Dawn""ù, I'm beginning to think Euron is going to be the final '""big bad""ù of the series. 

Many have predicted that the Others are moving south due to a pact having been broken. Or they are a dying species looking to bolster their ranks. And let's not forget the show's interpretation of the Others. There are several theories about their motivations, but the consistent theme is they have a motivation that isn't just killing (but that's always a possibility). 

I wouldn't be surprised if George played on our expectations and the Others turn out not to be the final battle. Euron is working in the background. He's playing with dark forces he may not entirely understand. And it seems like his goal IS to become the a version of the '""Great Other""ù. He wants to become a god like the Bloodstone Emperor. 

Now it's quite possible and probable that Euron is killed late in TWOW or early in ADOS, and the Others truly are the final conflict. But I think there's a chance Euron may be our heroes final confrontation in the series.

TL;DR : Euron is going to be the final villian of the series. The Others will be dealt with through another peace treaty, but there is no peace with Euron. He is the first storm and he will be the last. ",SPOILER

There is no way Anguy spent all 10,000 dragons on swan, Thoros is a true believer and gave whatever he had to the cause, and the group got lucky finding the Hound and his purse.

"Aegon I only had 2 children with his wives: at 34 he had Aenys, and Maegor at 39. It's a little strange, since most Targaryens had multiple children as long as their marriage lasted long enough, and most men had their first child at a much younger age.

Aenys was born in 7 AC, so he was conceived in 6 or 7 AC. Meanwhile in 7 AC, Orys Baratheon and his men were ransomed back, but Lord Wyl cut off their sword hands. In return, raged King Aegon burnt the castle of the Wyls to heaps of molten stone.

Maegor was conceived in 11 AC, which is the year of Dragon's Wrath. Aegon and Visenya burnt every castle in Dorne (except Sunspear) thrice over, to revenge Rhaenys.

Therefore we have a bold assumption: both Aenys and Maegor were conceived after Aegon burnt a castle in his wrath. Aegon's desire is aroused only after he burnt a castle.

How about Harrenhal, then? Well, neither Rhaenys nor Visenya was nearby to witness the destruction of Harrenhal, so...

It's more interesting that Aerys II, the last Dragon King, seemed inherited the first Dragon King's trait, only castles now deteriorate to men:

>The sight had filled him with disquiet, reminding him of Aerys Targaryen and the way a burning would arouse him. A king has no secrets from his Kingsguard. Relations between Aerys and his queen had been strained during the last years of his reign. They slept apart and did their best to avoid each other during the waking hours. But whenever Aerys gave a man to the flames, Queen Rhaella would have a visitor in the night. The day he burned his mace-and-dagger Hand, Jaime and Jon Darry had stood at guard outside her bedchamber whilst the king took his pleasure. ""You're hurting me,"" they had heard Rhaella cry through the oaken door. ""You're hurting me."" -AFFC, Jaime II

And Dany was probably conceived at this night.

I'm just curious about this topic.
We know that Winds of Winter won't contain the epilogue of the story but how far it will go ?
Will Dany arrive in Westeros at the end of the book or before ?
Will the long night/fight with the others take place in a Dream of Spring ? 

I Think Dany will start to invade Westeros at the end of the first book,  but how will she know about the others ? I think Jon Snow will have a role in this, in my opinion Jon will be the new King in the North in Winds of Winter and he will be in a desperate position to ask a meeting with Dany and maybe a political alliance against the Lannisters or any person that will control King's Landing.
The final book will cover the final fight with the others and the prophecy.

"I'm talking, of course, about this episode which took place in 13AC.

> Prince Nymor's peace proposals encountered strong opposition in King's Landing. Queen Visenya was hard set against them. '""No peace without submission,""ù she declared, and her friends on the king's council echoed her words. Orys Baratheon, who had grown bent and bitter in his later years, argued for sending Princess Deria back to her father less a hand. Lord Oakheart sent a raven, suggesting that the Dornish girl be sold into '""the meanest brothel in King's Landing, till every beggar in the city has had his pleasure of her.""ù Aegon Targaryen dismissed all such proposals; Princess Deria had come as an envoy under a banner of peace and would suffer no harm under his roof, he vowed.

>The king was weary of war, all men agreed, but granting the Dornishmen peace without submission would be tantamount to saying that his beloved sister Rhaenys had died in vain, that all the blood and death had been for naught. The lords of his small council further cautioned that any such peace could be seen as a sign of weakness and might encourage fresh rebellions, which would then need to be put down. Aegon knew that the Reach, the stormlands, and the marches had suffered grievously during the fighting, and would neither forgive nor forget. Even in King's Landing, the king dared not let the Dornish outside the Aegonfort without a strong escort, for fear that the smallfolk of the city would tear them to pieces. For all these reasons, Grand Maester Lucan wrote later, the king was on the point of refusing the Dornish proposals and continuing the war. 

>It was then that Princess Deria presented the king with a sealed letter from her father. '""For your eyes only, Your Grace.""ù

>King Aegon read Prince Nymor's words in open court, stone-faced and silent, whilst seated on the Iron Throne. When he rose afterward, men said, his hand was dripping blood. He burned the letter and never spoke of it again, but that night he mounted Balerion and flew off across the waters of Blackwater Bay, to Dragonstone upon its smoking mountain. When he returned the next morning, Aegon Targaryen agreed to the terms proposed by Nymor. Soon thereafter he signed a treaty of eternal peace with Dorne.


Now, I know there's been a couple of very good proposals about the content of this letter both in the book and in the subreddit, but one possibility I personally haven't seen brought up is this:

What if Dorne proposed some kind of secret eternal alliance to Targaryens?

This would explain the end of war. This would explain why Dornish armies fought alongside Targaryens later on. 

However, the main reason why I think this is possible is: this would explain the now existent secret alliance between Martells and Daenerys

What do you think?",SPOILER
"I am unsure if Daena the Defiant lived to see her son Daemon rebel, but if she had, I would think that she would support Daeron II over him. Elaena was entrenched in Daeron II's reign and he trusted her so much that she was given authority over state matters. It is unlikely that she had any love for or loyalty to Daemon Blackfyre given how close she and Daeron II were. Also, she ended up falling in love with a Dornishman, so if Daemon was rebelling due to hatred of Dorne, she would hate him for that and she probably agreed with Daeron II giving special privileges to Dorne.

Daena didn't seem fond of Aegon the Unworthy, never revealing the father to Daemon Blackfyre until several years after he was born. Furthermore, we have no idea what Daemon's relationship was like with his mother Daena. She could have treated him poorly, having resented the fact that he was part of the reason why her claim to the throne was thrown aside in favor of her uncle Viserys. Aegon the Unworthy could have seduced her with the intent of ruining her reputation to make his claim to the throne stronger. That theory is often espoused.

I think Daena was probably cold towards Daemon and Daemon and Aegor bonded over the fact that they were in general hated by the Targaryens since children for matters out of their control (such as Aegor's bitchy mother). 

I think she would have been a Targaryen loyalist like her beloved sister Elaena and Bloodraven, if only because Blackfyre is clearly the losing side.

"Hi all,

&#x200B;

Originally I started my thread exploring about GRRM inspirations into the ASOIAF lore and stumbled across the connections between Bran Stark, Night King and Jon Snow and Merlin and King Arthur. Digging a little deeper and I have since found that this welsh/celtic mythology was in fact a plagiarism of older Norse legends of Odin and Thor. MerlIN = odIN and thor = arTHUR. Nearly every main character is taken from norse myth and blended with other histories to create their character arcs e.g. hodor, tyr etc. Anyhow, whilst exploring norse mythology I came across key parts of the GOT series that seem to fit into these myths. Principally, Winterfell, Old nan, Bran Stark and the long night. To begin with, winterfell is a representation of Valhalla. In series 8 of GOT, we will be entering into the crypts of winterfell, which, if my predictions are confirmed, will reveal to the viewer a burial place of the old kings. In a way, this will resemble LOTR, when Aaragon enters the forest. In this scene, I imagine Jon snow playing a key role in requesting the alliances of the dead to defeat the dead (or something along those lines). The sword, light bringer (originally ice), will be crafted by the magic of Drogon, the craftsmanship of Gendry and the knowledge of Mellisandre acting as the key for jon snow to be identified by the dead. It would also explain why Jamie is currently heading north where brienne is waiting and the two swords will reunite. Within the crypts a werewood tree lies dormant, which Bran will, killed by ayra stabbed in the back by his own dagger (""wasted"" on a cripple) and die whilst trapped inside a vision; trapping his mind in the roots of the tree from his pale and lifeless physical body. In this instance, Bran's mark of the night king will continue to break the magic that protects him and prevents him from seeing the horrid truth. Trapped within his vision, Bran will turn to madness and manipulate all histories through his magic and interference with nature. That truth, must tie in with the children  of the forest, who must be the creators of evil for the pursuit of following natural cycles of death and rebirth. The over population of hel (just like in norse myth) is followed by Ragnarok (the long night), which cannot be stopped, only accepted. Old nan, like the vulvo in Balders dream, sits in hell to tell bran (odin) about the tales of his sons fate (jon snow and mankind and brans of past and present). However, just like Odin, Bran fears death, and to protect himself he is reliant on man building his army of the dead to protect him from himself (the night king). The night king, lord of light, drowned gods, faceless men, old gods and new, all require blood and death - all men must die. Whether its through the flames or necromancy, the animated dead through warging will protect Bran from being eliminated and time as we know it ending with him (like Odin fears the most). Bran at present is already indifferent to emotions, this is the start of his evil journey. In parallel to his story, Jamie, once hated for pushing innocent Bran out of a window, will become a saviour as Bran descends into madness. The magic of winterfell only survives through blood magic. A stark must always be in winter. However, this story does end, like GRRM wanted, as rebirth. Once the night king is able to complete his task of death to all men, the remaining three survivors, Sam, Gillie and baby sam, will be spared in order to relay the tale to the new age of men.",SPOILER
"I am trying to put this theory in a very compact way so noone is afraid of reading for hours. And it might even encourage questions, discussions and general comments.

&#x200B;

The participants of this theory:

&#x200B;

The Cerberus - often protrayed as a A three-headed dog, protecting the entrance to the underworld.

&#x200B;

The Hydra, sibling of the Cerberus  - A poisonous serpentine monster that can't be killed and that grows 2 heads for each chopped of head, so that the monster grows larger and larger.

&#x200B;

The Chimera, sibling of the Cerberus - often portrayed as a mixture between a lion a dragon, able to breath fire.

&#x200B;

The Nemean Lion, sibling of the Cerberus - whose golden fur could not be penetrated by mortal weapons and whose claws where sharper than mortal's swords. (insert rains of castamere lyrics here)

&#x200B;

The fearsome giant Typhon, who is probably the most deadly creature in Greek mythology, father of the Cerberus. the Hydra, the Nemean Lion and the Chimera. Typhon attempted to overthrow Zeus for the supremacy of the cosmos.

&#x200B;

Heracles, son of Zeus(who was married to Hera) and Alcmene, foster son of Amphitryon.

&#x200B;

Now the fun part of assigning ASOAIF characters to the ancient Greek characters!

&#x200B;

The fearsome giant Typhon represents Tywin Lannister. Father of the mentioned creatures. He overthrew house Targaryen during Roberts' Rebellion and is possibly the most deadly creature in the Seven Kingdoms.

So who are Tywins/Typhons children?

&#x200B;

The Hydra represents Cersei Lannister. Kill one of her children and the monster becomes bigger and bigger. The Hydra can only be killed with fire. Eventually resulting in Cerseis ultimate death - Dragon- or Wildfire.

&#x200B;

The Chimera represents Tyrion Lannister. Half lion, half Dragon. (Insert Tyrion is Targaryen theories here.)

&#x200B;

The Nemean Lion is Jaime - golden fur for his untouched Lannister armour, claws sharper than mortals' swords, because he is apparently the best alive - and in his prime - fighter in the realm.

&#x200B;

The Cerberus guarding the Underworld represents house Clegane, guarding house Lannister.

&#x200B;

Zeus and Alcmene represent Rhaegar and Lyanna. Amphitryon is Ned, fostering their son Jon/Heracles, who is the true hero of the stories. Hera is the wife of Zeus, so she is Elia Martell.

&#x200B;

Heracles'/Jons' first and second labour:

Killing the Hydra/Cersei and strangling a lion (insert Valonqar theory here - he is the younger brother of Aegon, that was killed by Gregor Clegane)

&#x200B;

The one weakness I see is that Heracles choked the Nemean Lion that represents Jaime and not the Hydra (Cersei), but my best guess is GRRM combined these characters in his books just as Jaime and Cersei often mention that they belong together.

&#x200B;

I hope this was not posted before (I could not find any similar theories) and I hope I was able to portray this in an understandable way since English is not my first language. If this was posted before I am truely sorry.

"I've read all the books and researched lots into Feudal Systems from Europe to Asia, but I'm still just a bit confused.

1. Ok so my first question is... what percentage of Westeros (roughly) do you reckon are 'noble'. Noble, meaning belong to houses, being any size from Stark or Lannister to Reed or Westerling. Because I feel like there are just so many houses, there must be so many noble people. Would it be like 1% of all people, or closer to something like 20%? Honestly, I just have no idea.
2. So where are all these people who aren't noble? Because we barely ever meet any people who aren't of a noble house. Even, for example when Brienne goes off around Westeros in AFFC, lots of the people she meets are noble.
3. Is the line between noble and not noble blurred? Or is it very black and white?

"Since the release of ADWD, there has been various theories surrounding the writer of the Pink Letter and the credibility of it's contents. However, I think the most plausible answer is that the author is Ramsay himself and that the contents of the letter are the truth. By taking this stance, there is several things we can take from the letter.

First of all, we have to accept the timeline of events. As in previous books, GRRM has took liberties with the order of events,  With certain chapters appearing first in the books before they happen chronologically in the story. As such, it's reasonable to believe that Theons chapter in the TWOW happens before Jon's chapter in which he receives the Pink Letter. If this is the case, that the Battle between Stannis and the Boltons has happened and the Letter is true we can deduce what has happened since the battle and what may happen next:

\>Your false king is dead, bastard. He and all his host were smashed in seven days of battle. I have his magic sword. Tell his red whore.

From this we know that Stannis' family has out lived him, as they are still alive in Jons chapter. Which is interesting to know, as now that Jon and Stannis have been killed, it leaves Shireeen, Seylse and their retinue in a precarious position.  The Crows, in an attempted to uphold there Neutrality and avoid the wrath of the Boltons may meet Ramsays Demands, which is likely considering the Crows didn't agree with The Nights Watch's support of Stannis in the first place. If the Crows did accept his demands that would also mean handing over Val and and Mance's ""Son"" which the Wildlings would strongly oppose, leading to an outright war between The Watch and the Wildlings.

\>And I want my Reek.

Ramsay has defeated Stannis, but still doesn't have Theon nor has he found his body (Burned or Beheaded), something Ramsay would make a priority. This means that he has escaped execution by Stannis and escaped the Bolton army. And by Asha's admission in the letter, its highly likely that she has escaped too.  As Ramsay has reason to suspect Jon is harbouring Theon, Theon and Asha may be on there way to the Wall. However, this might just be Ramsay's suspicion and it's unlikely they would go there with Jon as LC.

Moreover, Any mention of Rickon has been admitted from the letter. This mean one of two things, Davos hasn't  found Rickon or he hasn't found him yet. Either way, this tells us White Harbour hasn't raised it's banners against the Boltons. If, or when, Davos does finally find Rickon it leaves him with little options of places to go as the Watch will be Hostile to Davos and any Northern House wouldn't be in a strong enough position to challenge the Boltons rule. It is more likely, that even the most loyal Stark supporters would hand over Rickon and Davos to curry favour with the Boltons and avoid repercussions of hiding him.

"**Short version:** GRRM basically built Osmund to piss Jamie off!

## It starts with Tyrion...

>""You poor stupid blind crippled fool. Must I spell every little thing out for you? Very well. Cersei is a lying whore, she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know.

Tyrion's words cut hard and deep, as Jamie's inner thoughts through all AFfC will prove. It's worth pointing out that while Tyrion is wrong, since he's basing his accusation according to Varys' rumors (1), said insinuations aren't completely off the mark. Putting them into context, Varys insinuations make sense: back to ACoK Cersei was trying to make the Kettleblacks her creatures. Osmund promoted to KG, his brothers soon to be knighted""¶ let's not forget that Osmund is the one she bargained with since the beginning, given he's the older of the three.

Curiosity: their meetings back then""¶

>In truth, after a brief call at the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei would don a plain brown traveler's cloak and steal off to meet a certain hedge knight with the unlikely name of Ser Osmund Kettleblack, and his equally unsavory brothers Osney and Osfryd. Lancel had told him all about them. Cersei meant to use the Kettleblacks to buy her own force of sellswords.

""¶aren't that different from a Cersei and Jaime's one. This is during Tywin's wake, brown cloak once again.

>Cersei wiped her tears away on a ragged brown sleeve. ""Very well. If it is battlefields you want, battlefields I shall give you."" She jerked her hood up angrily. ""I was a fool to come. I was a fool ever to love you."" 

Regardless, it's quite clear that of all the Kettleblacks, Osmund is the one Cersei becomes attached to. This is unsurprising for three reasons: 

&nbsp;

1 there's no affection whatsoever towards Osney, sex with himis just a bargaining tool (2)

2 Osmund Kettleblak is the one who hangs around Cersei the most, being him  Kingsguard (notice that he's also always around Joffrey, whom he jokes with, and Tommen)

3 Osmund is useful to mock Jaime, as we will see in a bit.

&nbsp;

To top it all, given the current KG situation, for **Cersei choosing Osmund is almost a necessity**: Loras? She hates him. Boros Blount? Same, only to a minor degree. She despises him for having surrendered Tommen. Arys Oakheart is far away and with Jamie is full conflict. It's a coin toss between Osmund and Meryn Trant, and GRRM clearly likes to cheat the coin toss for dramatic purposes.

Whenever Meryn Trant's on scene the interaction is minimal, with Osmund there's always ""a bit more"".
 
>""Allow me a moment to dress. Ser Osmund, you shall accompany me to the Tower of the Hand.

Reread Cersei chapters and you'll notice just how many times Osmund is in the background! This is intentional, especially given that unlike Tyrion's saying""¶ well, Osmund hasn't done anything. Beside a glance here and there, but that's normal.(3)

**Cersei**, instead, **has been teasing.** Sometimes just to tie him up to her, 

>Ser Osmund Kettleblack fell in beside her on the steps, tall and lean in his Kingsguard whites. When Cersei was certain they were quite alone, she slid her arm through his. ""How is your little brother faring, pray?"" 
Ser Osmund looked uneasy. ""Ah . . . well enough, only . . .""

sometimes when Jaime's around""¶ to '""punish""ù him.

>Jaime hesitated. ""You should not stay alone.""""I will not be alone. Ser Osmund can remain with me and keep me safe. Your Sworn Brother."" ""If it please Your Grace,"" said Kettleblack.""It does."" Cersei slid her arm through his, and side by side they watched the fire rage. 


## Jaime's side

On Jaime's side, Osmund seems to be genetically engineered""¶ to piss him off:

* This is their very first interaction.

>Another knight in white armor was guarding the doors of the royal sept; a tall man with a black beard, broad shoulders, and a hooked nose. When he saw Jaime he gave a sour smile and said, ""And where do you think you're going?""
""Into the sept."" Jaime lifted his stump to point. ""That one right there. I mean to see the queen."" 
""Her Grace is in mourning. And why would she be wanting to see the likes of you?""
**Because I'm her lover [notice how this component starts immediately]**, and the father of her murdered son, he wanted to say.""Who in seven hells are you?""
""**A knight of the Kingsguard, and you'd best learn some respect, cripple**, or I'll have that other hand and leave you to suck up your porridge of a morning."" 
""I am the queen's brother, ser.""
(...)
>The dolt took a long look this time. ""Is it . . . Ser Jaime."" He straightened. ""My pardons, milord. I did not know you. I have the honor to be Ser Osmund Kettleblack."" 
Where's the honor in that? ""I want some time alone with my sister. See that no one else enters the sept, ser. If we're disturbed, I'll have your bloody head.""**[and they'll immediately have sex]**

Notice there's already the antipathy and the sexual thematic. 

* Then Osmund and Boros Blount do something dishonorable and vile.

>That was salt for his wound; Cersei had used his own men to do her bloody work, them and her precious Kettleblacks.

Insult to injury, the choice of words:

>""You witless fools,"" Jaime had snarled at Boros Blount and Osmund Kettleblack later, in a dungeon that stank of blood and death. ""**What did you imagine you were doing?**"" 
""No more'n we was told, my lord.""(""¶) ""Her Grace commanded it. Your sister.""

If there's someone in Westeros that gets pissed at KG hiding behind the ""just following orders"" mantra, that somebody is Jaime Lannister.




* To spite Jaime, Cersei wants Osmund to be promoted.

>""I don't want a proper master-at-arms. I want Ser Loras.""
""You make too much of that boy. Your little wife has filled your head with foolish notions of his prowess, I know, but Osmund Kettleblack is thrice the knight that Loras is."" 
Jaime laughed. ""Not the Osmund Kettleblack I know.""

Then the spite escalates, from master at arms to Lord Commander...

>""That's why I'm sending you. They may eat you as well, brave brother, but I trust you'll give them indigestion."" Cersei smoothed her skirt. ""I want Ser Osmund to command the Kingsguard in your absence.""

...to something even more insulting against the hot-blooded Jaime, because it implies masculinity.

>And I will not have Loras Tyrell commanding the Kingsguard.""
""Ser Loras is thrice the man Ser Osmund is."" 
""Your notions of **manhood** have changed somewhat, brother.""
Jaime felt his anger rising. ""True, Loras does not leer at your teats the way Ser Osmund does, but I hardly think""î"" 


Fun thing is, Cersei is quite fond of Osmund. How not to be, he's just a lickspittle and egomaniacs like Cersei love unconditional attention.  But liking him, or better: desiring him? No.

>It is me he's eager for, fool, the queen thought. All he wants of Margaery is the lordship between her legs. As fond as she was of Osmund, at times he seemed as slow as Robert. I hope his sword is quicker than his wits. The day may come that Tommen has some need of it.

Same physical build, same brain as Robert? What a turn off! (4)

* To top it all, Osmund is not a knight. 

Not just in theory, given his story about Ser Robert Stone is clearly a bullshit (5), but he also lacks any point in common with Jamie: when the KG are talking about Joffrey's death, he just gives a lazy shrug. He doesn't care. 

For Jaime, being a KG was a dream. For Osmund is""¶ well, it's not like he cares, at all. To top it all? The KG position is a gift *from Cersei herself.*

>What was Cersei thinking when she gave this one a white cloak?

## Jealousy

When Jaime questions Lancel, the truth comes out: Cersei's been unfaithful, and Jaime immediately includes Osmund in the list, although it's not true.

>"". . . womb,"" Lancel finished. ""It is not treason unless you finish inside. I gave her comfort, after the king died. You were a captive, your father was in the field, and your brother . . . she was afraid of him, and with good reason. He made me betray her.""
""Did he?"" Lancel and Ser Osmund and how many more? Was the part about Moon Boy just a gibe? ""Did you force her?"" 
""No! I loved her. I wanted to protect her.""

Fwiw I wrote something about the [Moon Boy part]( https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/765uzz/spoilers_main_grrms_cruel_irony_moon_boy_queens/), if you're interested.

The final irony is that Jaime will likely kill her sister for the only thing she's not guilty of. Even better, by her own admission.

>Cersei could hear Unella writing behind her. Her quill made a faint, soft scratching sound. ""Lancel Lannister, my cousin. And Osney Kettleblack."" Both men had confessed to bedding her, it would do her no good to deny it. ""His brothers too. Both of them."" She had no way of knowing what Osfryd and Osmund might say. **Safer to confess too much than too little.**

>The attack came sudden as a thunderbolt. Caraxes dove down upon Vhagar with a piercing shriek that was heard a dozen miles away, cloaked by the glare of the setting sun on Prince Aemond's blind side. The Blood Wyrm slammed into the older dragon with terrible force. Their roars echoed across the Gods Eye as the two grappled and tore at one another, dark against a blood red sky. So bright did their flames burn that fisherfolk below feared the clouds themselves had caught fire. Locked together, the dragons tumbled toward the lake. The Blood Wyrm's jaws closed about Vhagar's neck, her black teeth sinking deep into the flesh of the larger dragon. Even as Vhagar's claws raked her belly open and Vhagar's own teeth ripped away a wing, Caraxes bit deeper, worrying at the wound as the lake rushed up below them with terrible speed.

>And it was then, the tales tell us, that Prince Daemon Targaryen swung a leg over his saddle and leapt from one dragon to the other. In his hand was Dark Sister, the sword of Queen Visenya. As Aemond One-Eye looked up in terror, fumbling with the chains that bound him to his saddle, Daemon ripped off his nephew's helm and drove the sword down into his blind eye, so hard the point came out the back of the young prince's throat. Half a heartbeat later, the dragons struck the lake, sending up a gout of water so high that it was said to have been as tall as Kingspyre Tower.

>Neither man nor dragon could have survived such an impact, the fisherfolk who saw it said. Nor did they. Caraxes lived long enough to crawl back onto the land. Gutted, with one wing torn from his body and the waters of the lake smoking about him, the Blood Wyrm found the strength to drag himself onto the lakeshore, expiring beneath the walls of Harrenhal. Vhagar's carcass plunged to the lake floor, the hot blood from the gaping wound in her neck bringing the water to a boil over her last resting place. When she was found some years later, after the end of the Dance of the Dragons, Prince Aemond's armored bones remained chained to her saddle, with Dark Sister thrust hilt-deep through his eye socket. 

This is from The Princess and The Queen novella. I figure that since they're probably never gonna make a show about the Dance of the Dragons for budget reasons, they might adapt this scene in Season 8.

Outside the Manderlys and White Harbor, I found very few examples, if any, of Northerners worshiping the Faith. While we have a few Northern knights, the majority of them, such as Rodrik Cassel and the aforecited Ser Bartimus, seem to still worship the OG. The only Northern knight I could find who might (nominally) follow the Seven is Jorah Mormont, due to Illyario saying he was anointed by the High Septon and possibly also due to his marriage to Lynesse Hightower.

#The Sword that Unifies Mankind and Brings the Dawn.

[Since Jon is our grey-eyed lost prince that comes from a line of humans known for their high-civilization, born from a mother who comes from the rulers of the North](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/38hija/spoilers_all_i_cant_believe_i_just_realized_that/), and since George RR Martin credits Tolkien and *Lord of the Rings* [to being a great model for his series](https://imgur.com/a/oQY7Nwn) ([source](https://ew.com/article/2011/07/12/george-martin-talks-a-dance-with-dragons/)), then it follows that Jon takes after Aragorn and lightbringer is Jon's And√∫ril. You will see the clear connection shortly.

The forging of And√∫ril is packed full of symbolism, and its threefold:

 - The reforging of the broken sword represented the restoration of the line of the Kings of Gondor.

 - Aragorn taking the sword represents him taking up and accepting his identity as king of Gondor.

 - The reforging represented the unification of mankind under one ruler to fight Sauron in his darkness.

It follows that since lightbringer seems to be a central sword that it too should have a lot of symbolism behind it.

Instead of just pulling this out of my rear end and putting it on a platter for you, you can see the resemblance of it in Stannis's faux-lightbringer as well as regular lightbringer to Narsil/Anduril.

First, let's look at faux-lightbringer as well as a description of what lightbringer is supposed to be:

>**Glowing like sunset, a red sword** was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow.

> - Daenerys IV ACoK 

>Stannis Baratheon drew Lightbringer.

>The sword glowed red and yellow and orange, alive with light. Jon had seen the show before ""¶ but not like this, never before like this. **Lightbringer was the sun made steel...**

>He slipped Lightbringer into its scabbard, and the world darkened once again, as if the sun had gone behind a cloud.

> - Jon III ADwD

I say *faux-lightbringer* because George RR Martin seems to be telling us through Salladhor Saan and Jon/Maester Aemon tell us that it isn't (one through telling the legend that doesn't align with Stannis's lightbringer and the other saying that the sword doesn' t have its own heat).

And now how lightbringer is supposed to be:

>""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. **In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.**"" She lifted her voice, so it carried out over the gathered host. ""Azor Ahai, beloved of R'hllor! The Warrior of Light, the Son of Fire! Come forth, your sword awaits you! Come forth and take it into your hand!""

> - Davos I ACoK

**Narsil**:

>Narsil n. '**Red [and] white [flame]**' according to the Index in The Lord of the Rings; cf. Anar 'Sun' and Isil 'Moon'.

**And√∫ril**:

>And√∫ril n. '**West-flame'**.

Looking at the word And√∫ril more closely via etymology:

>**and√∫n√´ 'sunset, west'** in And√∫ni√´, to which corresponds in Sindarin ann√ªn, cf. Ann√∫minas, and Henneth Ann√ªn 'window of the sunset' in Ithilien. The ancient root of these words, ndu, meaning 'down, from on high', appears also in Quenya n√∫men 'the way of the sunset, west' and in Sindarin d√ªn 'west', cf. D√∫nedain, Ad√ªnaic ad√ªn in Ad√ªnakh√¥r, Anad√ªn√™ was a loan from Eldarin speech....

We can see the clear connection between the sun/(red) flames between this series and *Lord of the Rings*, meaning that this serves as evidence of inspiration for the series.

And√∫ril served as a beacon of light for all mankind in the darkness which Sauron casted.  And√∫ril represented many things, one of which was a broken sword being reforged represented the unification of a divided mankind behind the ruler who wielded the sword reforged.

#The Sword that Slays the Ice Dragon

In Jon's chapter, reading from a book on the Azor Ahai prophecy, Jon notes something:

>""I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. **The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife's blood if Votar can be believed. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot. Once Azor Ahai fought a monster.** *When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.""*

> - Jon III ADwD

>Sailors from half a hundred nations have glimpsed these great beasts over the centuries, so mayhaps there is some truth behind the tales. Archmaester Margate has suggested that many legends of the north""îfreezing mists, ice ships, Cannibal Bay, and the like""îcan be explained as distorted reports of ice-dragon activity. Though an amusing notion, and not without a certain elegance, this remains the purest conjecture. As ice dragons supposedly melt when slain, no actual proof of their existence has ever been found.

> - The World of Ice and Fire - Beyond the Free Cities: The Shivering Sea.

There is good evidence that Viserion will die just like the show and be revived (see bottom).

The description of the beast being slain and the Ice Dragon being slain are very similar. It *does* sound like a dragon being slain. For further evidence of it being an ice dragon, the beast being slain sounds like Sam slaying an Other:

>And then he was stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, closing his eyes and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both hands. He heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath a man's foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went staggering backward with his hands over his muffled ears, and fell hard on his arse.

>When he opened his eyes the Other's armor was running down its legs in rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass dagger in its throat. It reached down with two bone-white hands to pull out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked.

>Sam rolled onto his side, eyes wide as the Other shrank and puddled, dissolving away. In twenty heartbeats its flesh was gone, swirling away in a fine white mist. Beneath were bones like milkglass, pale and shiny, and they were melting too. Finally only the dragonglass dagger remained, wreathed in steam as if it were alive and sweating. Grenn bent to scoop it up and flung it down again at once. ""Mother, that's cold.""

> - Samwell I ASoS

And since Jon is the only one who has references to an Ice Dragon outside the constellation, then it seems to me that this is an indication that Jon will encounter one:

>The ice pressed close around them, and he could feel the cold seeping into his bones, the weight of the Wall above his head. It felt like walking down the gullet of an ice dragon.

> - Jon VIII ASoS

>They rode the winch lift back to the ground. The wind was gusting, **cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales Old Nan** had told when Jon was a boy.  *

> - Jon VII ADwD
    
>The road beneath the Wall was as **dark and cold as the belly of an ice dragon** and as twisty as a serpent. 

> - Jon VIII ADWD   
    

>The snowfall was light today, a thin scattering of flakes dancing in the air, but the wind was blowing from the east along the Wall, **cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales Old Nan** used to tell. Even Melisandre's fire was shivering; the flames huddled down in the ditch, crackling softly as the red priestess sang. Only Ghost seemed not to feel the chill.

> - Jon X ADwD

#Ice Reforged:

**The Return of the Starks and Jon accepting his dual identity**

The Red Comet appears in the chapter right after Ned is beheaded with Ice:

>""For a certainty,"" Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and **noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky**.

> - Bran VII AGoT

>That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.**

> - Arya I ACoK

>""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that **there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him**.""ù

> - Davos I ACoK

>Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""**It is the sword that slays the season**,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

> - Bran I ACoK

Tyrion's PoV of one of the two swords made from Ice:

>Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black, as was true here as well. But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey. The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore.

> - Tyrion IV ASoS

The broken sword Narsil represented the line of the Kings of Gondor and how it was apparently extinct with Aragorn's disappearance to the world. Everyone thought the line was broken.  Similarly, Ice was reworked by Tywin Lannister into two blades around the time the Red Wedding happened, which is an event that marked the apparent extinction of the Stark line at the hands of the Lannisters (which is why the Rains of Castamere was played at it).

The reforging of the broken sword And√∫ril also served as a representation of Aragorn's identity, his acceptance of it, and the restoration of the line of the kings. Aragorn taking up this sword was him accepting his identity as a king.

Jon taking up Ice reforged will represent him and his acceptance of his identity as both a Targaryen and a Stark. The restoration of the blade will represent the restoration of the Stark line from the apparent extinction and their comeback from the Lannisters (in a time in the books that was named ""A Time for Wolves"". And very well could also represent the return of the dragons since Ice reforged is likely to have Targaryen colors, embodying that ice-fire theme).

The restoration of the blade also can be seen as representative of the restoration of Westeros from central conflict that was embodied by the breaking of the blade: the war between the Lannisters and Starks.

I'd venture to say the blade is named ""Fire"" after all of what I have presented here, as well as Ice being the cover of the first book in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series.

So here the symbolism is threefold. The blade represents:

 - The unification of a divided humanity behind one ruler and one cause: to fight the Others and the army of the undead.

 - The restoration of the Stark line (possibly even the Targaryens/return of the dragons).

 - Jon accepting himself as a Stark and a Targaryen.

#Two Swords > One?

This is a legitimate question in regards to this theory.  But I think it can easily be answered, as I seriously think Sam is on the way to discovering the secrets to Valyrian Steel in order to prepare humanity for the long night making the need for two swords obsolete, creating a stronger incentive for the Starks to reforge the sword.

#Viserion death foreshadowing

>**The white cyvasse dragon ended up at Tyrion's feet. He scooped it off the carpet and wiped it on his sleeve, but some of the Yunkish blood had collected in the fine grooves of the carving, so the pale wood seemed veined with red**. ""All hail our beloved queen, Daenerys."" Be she alive or be she dead. He tossed the bloody dragon in the air, caught it, grinned. ""We have always been the queen's men,"" announced Brown Ben Plumm. ""Rejoining the Yunkai'i was just a plot.""

> - Tyrion I TWoW

>""It is only a tale, Khaleesi,"" said her exile knight. ""They talk of wise old dragons living a thousand years as well.""

>""**Well, how long does a dragon live?"" She looked up as Viserion swooped low over the ship**, his wings beating slowly and stirring the limp sails.

>Ser Jorah shrugged. ""A dragon's natural span of days is many times as long as a man's, or so the songs would have us believe . . . but the dragons the Seven Kingdoms knew best were those of House Targaryen. They were bred for war, and in war they died. It is no easy thing to slay a dragon, but it can be done.""

> - Daenerys I ASoS

>Dany fled from the choice, out onto the terrace. She found Rhaegal asleep beside the pool, a green and bronze coil basking in the sun. Drogon was perched up atop the pyramid, in the place where the huge bronze harpy had stood before she had commanded it to be pulled down. He spread his wings and roared when he spied her. **There was no sign of Viserion**, but when she went to the parapet and scanned the horizon she saw pale wings in the far distance, sweeping above the river. He is hunting. They grow bolder every day. Yet it still made her anxious when they flew too far away. **One day one of them may not return, she thought.**

"Why did the Valyrians practice blood magic in the way they did?

&#x200B;

We've seen that blood magic such as Mel's (Precognition/Healing/Ressurection/Shadowbinding) can be a massive force multiplyer, allowing much weaker players of the game to match far stronger ones relying on more eartly means.

It's been implied that fire magic was used by the Valyrians to control to Fourteen Flames which may have included regular blood sacrifices.

"If Blackwood and Bracken were countries, they would have been the small countries that started World War I.

Essentially, I despise both of these houses, but after finishing Fire and Blood, I think I despise Blackwood more. It is obvious that Martin has a preference and writes one house as demonic and the other as saintly. Bracken lacks humanity; Blackwood is endless in its angelic accomplishments. This would not be so bothersome if they had not been houses full of different (and related) people.

The laughable Benjicot Blackwood being a seasoned military commander at age 11? I mostly found the Dance of the Dragons riveting but then comes this bullshit simply as another display of Martin's useless favoritism. It took me right out of the story.

Black Aly marries Cregan Stark and is solely responsible for there not being another civil war. I rolled my eyes.

Despite sleeping with a very married Aegon the Unworthy, Melissa Blackwood is a gorgeous saint who befriends all, including Naerys, Daeron, and Aemon. Yes, she is having sex with the married king, but she is not a schemer. She is simply pure. Meanwhile, Barba Bracken schemes directly after having given birth and then grooms her little sister who is brutally murdered. This is the second time that I rolled my eyes.

Bloodraven is a piece of shit, but all of his terrible actions are excused because he is essentially saving the kingdom and the world. He is even cited as a good Hand despite several blunders, such as letting the Ironborn raid because he is too obsessed with the ill-conceived Blackfyre rebellions and turning Westeros into a police state. This is a favorite character among the base, but I find him a mostly annoying character who is clearly a self-insert.

Oh, a Blackwood becomes a Targaryen princess and then queen. Too bad their children fucked up their reign.

Tytos Blackwood vs. Jonos Bracken: Even the enemy Lannister loves the Blackwoods and respects them. Meanwhile, Jonos Bracken is an idiot who cheats on his wife or whatever. This is another instance where I rolled my eyes so hard.

The Blackfyre rebellions are essentially Blackwood vs. Bracken. In fact, the Blackfyres aren't really characters in this feud. No, instead we focus on Bloodraven and Bittersteel. Other than the fact that legitimized bastards have never caused a succession war in European history, I just hate reading about these because they make the Blackfyres (secretly Brackens) so incompetent that they are not believable as threatening villains. Blackwoods/Targaryens fight some idiots who probably don't know which way is right and which way is left. Fascinating. Not.

Whenever I see any threads about how much we love the Blackwoods and hate the Brackens, I find it so stupid because Martin doesn't give Blackwoods any faults, while he gives Brackens nothing but faults. Of course you love the Blackwoods. They have literally done nothing wrong.

Of all House feuds, this is the shittiest one with terrible writing and absolutely no nuance.

"From what I can gather there is a large meta-narrative game between creators which involves A Song of Ice and Fire as an early progenitor or participant. This has been going on for over three decades, perhaps longer.

I'll begin by using Orson Scott Card's Ender Quartet (of Ender's Game fame) to evidence some cross-narrative connections.

**Warning: spoilers will be involved** due to sourcing quotes and concepts from the Ender Quartet. This is the first in a series of posts I'll be writing on the similarities. As an introduction there will be a fair amount of set-up familiarizing readers with plot points and key concepts for those who have not read the Ender Quartet. If you don't want to be spoiled you can always bookmark the page and return here once you've read the series.

##The Stranger

>He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life""îhowever long that might be""îhe would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name.

>-Jon IX, AGOT

>And the seventh face... the Stranger was neither male nor female, yet both, ever the outcast, the wanderer from far places, less and more than human, unknown and unknowable.

>-Catelyn IV, ACOK

Ender is essentially a non-entity in the files of the ruling Hegemony, as his identity is protected by the highest security possible. Despite being Ender the Xenocide his students only know him as Andrew Wiggin, itinerant Speaker. He never puts roots down on any of the planets he visits or makes concrete connections aside from his sister Valentine, thus making him 'unknown and unknowable'.

>""Everyone calls him Quim."" The nickname was pronounced like **the word *king* in Stark**. It began because his middle name is Rei but now it's because he thinks he rules by divine right.

>""**Bastard**,"" said Quim. He stalked out of the room.

>At the same time the others settled in for conversation. **Miro had decided to accept the stranger**, at least temporarily; therefore they could let down their guard a little.

>-Ch. 7 ""The Ribeira House"", Speaker for the Dead

A man named king in Stark calls the stranger a bastard, invoking Jon Snow. The difference between the two is worth noting, however. Jon, assuming R+L=J, is a king passed off as a Stark bastard and has the shadow imagery of the stranger. This exemplifies how the cross-narrative concepts used are often split apart and re-assembled throughout the different series taking part in this meta-game.

Ender is a long-time outcast of the Hegemony, the ruling worlds of Card's universe. Card's Hegemony is the Hundred Worlds while Martin has his Thousand Worlds. Ender's role as the Stranger and the Speaker for the Dead concerns death as a funerary rite. He decided to take on the name in response to the events of Ender's Game in which he killed an entire species known as the buggers. After being philotically linked (psychic magic) with the only remaining Hive Queen cocoon, he writes a book, the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, indicting the Xenocide Ender committed and spreading understanding of the dead species. As a Speaker Ender performs this same role throughout many different worlds over many thousands of years due to the effect of relativistic travel times in universe. This eventually brings him to the colony of Lusitania to determine if the Pequeninos (also called piggies) are 'raman' or 'varelse', a species we can coexist with or not. His hope is to use the mostly untouched world to rebirth the last Hive Queen. In this sense Ender is much like the Stranger of the Seven, identifying and commiserating with the non-human alien species as much as with his fellow humans.

##Only Half Man

>The Stranger in the shadows, **his half-human face** concealed beneath a hooded mantle.

>-Jaime IV, AFFC

>The Speaker, however, followed **lines of thought alien to Miro**. Even though **he wore a human shape**, it made Miro wonder if Ender really was a framling--he could be as baffling as the piggies. He was as much a ramen as they were, **alien but still not animal**.

>-Ch. 14 ""Renegades"", Speaker for the Dead

Both Jon and Ender are described as being unhuman in the manner of ghosts.

>**[H]is white skin made him look sickly** compared to the thousand shades of brown of the Lusos. **Ghostly**.

>-Ch. 15 ""Speaking"", Speaker for the Dead

>**When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white** and moaning for blood... Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour.

>-Arya IV, AGOT

To further the connection of a Speaker not being fully human is the novel's initial insights into Novinha Ribeira. Novinha originally put out the call for a Speaker for the Dead that drew Ender to Lusitania.

>For he loved her, as you can only love someone who is **an echo of yourself** at your time of deepest sorrow.

>-Ch. 5 ""Valentine"", Speaker for the Dead

>""**And someone else is in you. The Speaker for the Dead.** That's who you want to be.""

>""It's the only true story I ever heard,"" she said. ""The only one I care about. Is that what you wanted to hear?""

>...

>""What I wanted to hear,"" said Pipo softly, ""was the name of what you are instead of all the things you are not. What you are is the hive queen. **What you are is the Speaker for the Dead**. It's a very small community, small in numbers, but a great-hearted one. So you chose not to be part of the bands of children who group together for the sole purpose of excluding others, and people look at you and say, poor girl, she's so isolated, but you know a secret, you know who you really are. You are the one human being who is **capable of understanding the alien mind because you *are* the alien mind; you know what it is to be unhuman** because there's never been any human group that gave you credentials as a bona fide homo sapiens.""

>""**Now you say I'm not even human?**""

>-Ch. 1 ""Pipo"", Speaker for the Dead

A small, great-hearted community seems to invoke the magical communities we sometimes see in ASOIAF: most directly with the Warlocks of Qarth around their fiery indigo heart and the greenseers in Bloodraven's cave connected to heart trees.

>""The way you say it, you make it sound as easy as writing a scholarly paper. You don't know what it was like to write the Hive Queen and the Hegemon. How much agony it was for him to--**to imagine himself inside an alien mind**...""

>-Ch. 1 ""Pipo"", Speaker for the Dead

The matter of community seems to be at the center of an archetypal stranger -- or more accurately of otherization and alienation, the exclusion from or lack of participation in a community. Ender becomes associated less and less with the stranger as he becomes part of the town of Milagre and a member of the Ribeira family. This transition arises due to his reason for arriving: to learn if the Hive Queen can be born on Lusitania and if the piggies are raman or varelse. We learn that both the xenobiologist and xenologer of Lusitania have been aiding the piggies, interfering with their cultural development, in direct violation of Hegemony law. This spurs Ender to appeal to the leaders of Milagre to rebel against Hegemony intervention and allow further contact with the piggies.

>""I submit to your authority,"" said Ender, ""because I don't want to be a framling here. I want to be your citizen, your student, your parishioner.""

>""As a Speaker for the Dead?"" asked the Bishop.

>""As Andrew Wiggin. I have some other skills that might be useful. Particularly if you rebel...""

>""We don't doubt your sincerity,"" said the Bishop. ""But you must forgive us if we are doubtful about casting in with a citizen who is something of a latecomer.""

>Ender nodded. The Bishop could not say more until he knew more. ""Let me tell you first what I know.""

>-Ch. 16 ""The Fence"", Speaker for the Dead

Ender, as well as playing the Stranger, plays a variation on the roles of the Last Hero, the creator of the Pact between First Men and Children, and Brandon the Builder.

>""The manner in which Brandon [the Builder] learned to comprehend the speech of the children is a tale in itself, and not worth repeating here.""

>-Ancient History: The Dawn Age, TWOIAF

This seems to raise many questions: How long has this been going on? What is the purpose? Is Martin the originator and gave the ideas to other creators then re-purposed their use in his own series? Or is Martin one of a group that is working some sort of co-operative meta-narrative project? 

Ender's Game is the oldest entry in this tradition that I am aware of and it was published in 1985, over a decade before AGOT. Are there examples that predate Card's work?

Most importantly: What other series are involved and where have you seen this use of cross-narrative collaboration? What information can we take from these different series to help suss out certain issues in ASOIAF?

These aren't rhetorical questions I'm asking. I want to hear what people have to say on the matter.",SPOILER

"So she tells Daenerys ""Winterfell is yours, your grace"". But I think Sansa isn't really happy with Jon's decision to bend the knee to Daenerys. I do think she will see some benefit in siding with Daenerys to fight Cersei and the undead but will eventually betray her as she has no real desire to submit to her. 

I believe Sansa would much rather uphold her familys legacy rather than submit to Daenerys. At the end of the day Rob was proclaimed King in the North as was Jon (who's true parentage she is unaware of), her own father played a massive role in the rebellion which brought down the Targaryens and it was Daenerys' father that killed her Grandfather and uncle so why submit to a Targaryen permanently after all of that? 

I think if she finds out Jons true parenatage there may even be a coup in order. She doesn't want to submit to the iron throne any more and would much rather have an independent north. That's how I think it will go down. What are your thoughts? 

btw I haven't seen any leaks so I would appreciate it if you don't mention them if you have seen them. Thank you.",SPOILER
"In *Dance*, Tyrion seems to push Aegon away from Daenerys and towards taking the Iron Throne himself potentially creating a rift between the two Targaryens and causing another Dance of Dragons. He's pretty spiteful and bitter at this point, and I wonder if he'll intentionally pit Dany and Aegon against each other to get revenge on Westeros.

In the show, there's speculation that the eighth season has Tyrion betray the Stark/Targaryen alliance and die for it.

I wonder what dark twists and turns Tyrion will take. What do you think? Will he find peace, or is he destined to become the monster Westeros always thought him to be?",SPOILER
"I have been talking to a few people recently and the idea that Dany/Jon or whoever gains the Throne in the end should destroy it keeps coming up. Can someone explain why destroying the Iron Throne at the end of the series (show or books) is a good thing to do? Why its symbolically necessary? I might be a total idiot here, but i dont get it.

Aegon the Conquerer might have been a mass murderer, but there was some sense to his method (madness). Westeros was squandering lives and resources with constant wars between and within Kingdoms. Even with the destructive wars post conquest, Westeros general population has tripled at least if the levy the Reach can raise now compared to back then is anything to go by (and it outright says in Fire and Blood). The Iron Throne may be built on blood and sacrifice, but in many ways it is a symbol for Justice and Peace within Westeros. The first Law ever passed on it was the Kings Peace, there could be no wars between his vassals, any grievances, smallfolk would take to their lords, their lords to their liege lords and so on. Any man who violated this peace, became the enemy of the Iron Throne.

Aegon forged the Throne with the help of his dragon, Balerion the Black Dread, from the blades of his defeated enemies. It sends out a harsh message, but it shows how Aegon was able beat the enemies into submission through strength and skill. Earning the eternal respect of all future lords (had they found some way to deify Aegon, it would not surprise me if he was worshipped). It is massive, intimidating and ugly but it is dependable and even in times of struggle, lords and smallfolk gravitate towards it.

Whats most important is the seat is not comfortable, you cant lean back. For a 'king should never sit easy'. The whole purpose is too ensure that the king doesnt become complacent and remains attentive. Reminding them of the position of power they are in and the great height reminds the monarch that those beneath quite literally look to him for answers.

Another point, sacrifice. The Iron Throne is known to 'judge' those it finds unworthy, and cuts them. Aerys the Mad King was cut so often people called him 'king scab'. Aerys was a raving lunatic who tried to blow up a city of his own people. He was killed at the foot of the Iron Throne, his blood pooled at the bottom of it. A sacrifice, to cleanse the Iron Throne of his madness.

Maegor the Cruel also broke Aegon's first ruling, in essentially declaring war on his own people in a futile effort to kill all remaining Poor Fellows and Warriors Sons. He would bring back 2000 skulls, largely thought to be innocents. The Iron Throne would cleanse itself with Maegor's own blood as he died sitting on it. With Maegor's death (sacrifice), a golden age ensued under the greatest Targaryen King there has been, Jaehaerys the Wise.

Jaehaerys did even more for the Iron Throne, by unifying the code of law of the 7 Kingdoms (well 6). The Iron Throne becoming even more intrinsic to the realm as now it was a binding point for all the kingdoms.

Things have changed in Westeros. Rodrik the Reader noted this himself, things cannot go back to the days of 7 Kingdoms. It makes no sense. Aegon forged the realm anew with his conquest, and Jaehaerys bound them together with law. The autonomy of the 7 Kingdoms cannot truly return. And why should it? All the Kingdoms have prospered, even Dorne. The only one that hasn't are the Iron Islands, but that is because in their stubborness they refuse to accept change.

What surprises me is that all the noble houses in Westeros seem to only have one seat. The only exemption I can think of would be Summerhall. In Europe it has always been usual to have multiple seats, for example one in the capital, one in the country meant for luxury and one that is defendable.

Vale is probably next with their loyalty to the Arryns and then maybe the Stormlands and the Baratheons.

"Hey all, I was thinking about Rickard Stark's supposed Sothron Ambitions, and I just realized that I don't understand what his end goal was.

Sorry if this is a lazy post, but whenever I've heard about the theory no one ever mentions an actual goal. He was marrying Brandon and Lyanna to other high lords. His fostering Ned in the Eyrie was likely related to that too. He probably would have married Ned and Benjen to important houses from the Reach and or Dorne, though I'll admit that's speculation on my part. But what is it all adding up to? None of those put the Starks any closer to being on the Iron Throne. Was he planning to overthrow the Targs by force, and made all these alliances to gain the force to do so?

"Child marriage seems to be pretty common in Westeros. For example, Sansa Stark was betrothed to Jefferey at the age of 13.

"I think I know how it's going to end with bran stark. I'm a big junkie when it comes to game of thrones/a song of ice and fire books. Here is my theory:

Brandon stark is the last hero azor ahai, and literally everyone else dies in a bloodbath a la Macbeth. So it is up to him to warg back in time and warns everyone about what is going to happen ( he already warged back in time with Hodor so it is indeed possible)

Think of Trunks from dragon Ball z, how he travelled back in time to warn the alternative universe about the destruction that awaits them.

Bran wargs into a first man (original stark?) back in time, and tells the first men about the events that are to come in the future, and how they must build the wall, and build winterfell, and build storms end etc to ensure there are bastions of defense against the coming tides of undead.

The ""long night"" and the ""age of heroes"" that is referenced in the book and show are the world's history, but this theory proposes that they are future events relayed to the first men by bran, but then the stories take on a life of their own as they are passed down through generation orally via broken telephone. So over time the original point that these stories are based on the future is lost, and people think they are past events when in reality they are still yet to come.

Think of Dantes inferno, or beowulf, or most native canadian stories which are passed down in the oral tradition, they change and adapt over time. The names of the original characters are lost, and the deeds are all exaggerated rendering them unrecognizable. But the events in the ""age of heroes"" are eerily similar to the happenings in the current day timeline.

So bran goes back in time and warns everyone about the thrashing they are about to get from the white walkers.

The cherry on top to this theory? In the teaser trailer for the show Jon Arya and Sansa go to the bottom of the winterfell crypts where the oldest Kings of winter should be, and they find themselves!!!!!

Also, the name of the final book is ""a dream of spring"" , which to me sounds like spring is a long long away, at the end of a ""long night"".

What do you guys think?",SPOILER
"So I'm wrapping up my second read-through of *Fire & Blood*, and I'm curious as to what people think were the biggest mistakes made by the various sides throughout the Dance.

I want to specify that I'm not talking about intelligent decisions that nevertheless had disastrous consequences - while you might feel (as I do) that the Greens were wrong to take the Throne from Rhaenyra, and that that choice was disastrous in the long term, it was nevertheless carried out ably - if you're trying to carry out the inheritance in a way that contradicts the wishes of the previous king, then hiding that king's death for as long as possible so you can consolidate power is a good move. The same goes for decisions where the party involved didn't have enough information to make the right choice - while sending Aegon the Younger and Viserys had disastrous consequences, Daemon and Rhaenyra had no way of knowing they would be intercepted en route by a naval power that they did not yet know had decided to enter the war. I'm talking about instances where someone had the knowledge required to make the right choice and chose...poorly.

Here's some examples of what I'm talking about:

**Attainting Allyn Velaryon and Nettles**

This is the big one. While Hugh Hammer and Ulf White's betrayal must have been a real gut punch, they weren't plugged in to the feudal system like Allyn Velaryon (whose father is the freakin' Hand) or connected to someone you *know* is loyal like Daemon (no, she's not a sorceress Rhaenyra...). This decision compounded the disaster at Tumbleton by not only further reducing the Black's strategic advantage in dragons, but alienating the Black's most loyal vassals (the Velaryons and the Mootons). If they had kept Allyn on hand they might have had enough dragonriders on hand to prevent the storming of the Dragonpit, and if Daemon had had some backup he might have survived his fight with Aemond and Vhagar (though with Alys Rivers it's debatable whether Aemond would have showed up then). A transparently bad decision with many negative consequences for the Blacks. 

**Aemond Sucks**

While Criston Cole went south to meet up with Lord Hightower's army, Aemond One-Eye ~~made the sensible decision to escort Cole~~ decided to just burn shit in the Riverlands. God you suck, Aemond. Not only was his decision morally reprehensible, it also had zero strategic benefit and it completely screwed over Cole and his army - I highly doubt his host would have been ambushed and destroyed if he had had Vhagar running recon and backup. Fuck Aemond.

**Not Awarding Hugh and Ulf**

This one's a little less clear-cut - as we see, Daemon wanted to award Ulf White and Hugh Hammer by marrying them to the heirs of Rosby and Stokeworth (and of course deciding that the daughters would be the heirs in the first place). Citing their (extremely) low birth and the instability that would follow in privileging female succession, Corlys Velaryon talked Rhaenyra out of it. Ulf and Hugh then almost immediately defected to the Greens at Tumbleton.

While awarding Ulf and Hugh these lordships would have prevented their immediate defection, it is definitely an open question as to whether that would have satisfied their appetite or simply whetted it further. Would it have been the right call? What do you think?

What other mistakes and blunders from the Dance do you want to point out? What stood out to you? What other consequences came from attainting Allyn and Nettles?

Most importantly, how much does Aemond suck?",SPOILER

* Horse-breaking comes naturally to a skinchanger.

* Finally, there is one more similarity with another skinchanger. Bloodraven slew Daemon and his two sons with weirwood arrows from an unlikely range, which was sorcery if Ser Eustace is to be believed. Black Aly is said to have slain Ser Amos Bracken by firing a weirwood arrow into the slit of his helm. In fact, this archery feat does not seem to have anything to do with skinchanging; rather, it might be some kind of sorcery. We saw Brandon Snow preparing weirwood arrows, which most readers thought to be meant for dragons but I think Brandon Snow was thinking of their riders. Weirwood arrows guided by sorcery can find the eye of a dragonrider even upon flight.

"I don't usually visit this sub, and haven't read up on very many of the theories of the last few years, so I'm not sure if any of this has been discussed before. I didn't find anything in a search, but I also didn't dig through everything. Anyway, I had a few ideas that I wanted to get some thoughts on. Probably mostly of the tinfoil hat variety, but they won't stop rattling around in my head so I will leave them here.

The thought that popped into my head last night was somewhat of a meta-theory. What if GRRM has been done with TWoW for months now, but they aren't going to release it until after the show is done. Why? Because it's possible that the series ends at the end of TWoW, and that the last book could go beyond what we see on HBO. If that were the case, they might want to keep the book under wraps until the last season has aired. It could also explain why there was such a long gap between the last season and this one coming up.

Something else I thought about that could support that is the name of the show. Maybe it's called Game of Thrones because it only deals with the wars between the houses. Whereas the books are a broader story.

A Song of Ice and Fire isn't just about the Lannisters vs the Starks or any other of the houses. It's also about the war between light and dark. So GoT may take us to the final battle that settles the question of who rules the 7 kingdoms, but the larger war will take place after that is settled. Maybe after Jon and Danaerys's son is born, or maybe several years later.

That would explain some of the more notable changes between the books and the show. For example, the Horn of Winter. Maybe it's not important until later. Same with Mance Rayder and his baby. They didn't need them anymore because their story won't be told on the show. Lady Stoneheart? Lots of omissions make sense in this light. Maybe that was the plan from the beginning.

Back to Jon and Danaerys's son. I think that's pretty likely. But it means that now that Jon has put his seed in her, he's fulfilled his entire purpose. A good way to give viewers an emotional gut punch would be to have Jon die. I'd do it at the end of the first episode.

But that would beg the question ""What's so special about their kid? She's a full-bred Targaryen. He's half wolf, half dragon. The only reason their kid would be special is if Jon were pure-bred wolf. But he's not. Is he? I mean, just because we know Lyanna is his mother doesn't mean Ned WASN'T his father. Right?

Maybe Rhaegar ""abducted"" an already-impregnated-with-Ned's-seed Lyanna with the specific purpose of making the child appear to be his. In other words, just an ordinary mixed-blood bastard. Rather than the pure-bred Stark that he is. A lot of theories revolve around whether Rhaegar had some prophetic vision of what was to come and what he had to do.

That would explain a LOT! How the abduction story varied in odd ways. Rhaegars melancholy. Maybe even why he dedicated his life to getting good at everything. It would make Jon special. And it would make Jon and Danaerys's kid the prince who was promised.

But since that comes later, all we get on the show is the bit that related to the start of Robert's Rebellion, and confirmation that the boy is Lyanna's.

I think that this would be the best of both worlds. The story on HBO gets one conclusion, and the book series goes one further.

OK. I'm beat. Going to bed.

Oh, one more thing. I think that Tyrion Targaryen has a strong possibility of being true. But they didn't give him Targaryen traits on the show because that doesn't matter until later.

TL;DR It's probably for the best that you didn't read it.

"A bit of circumstantial evidence; both have minimal origin stories, Howland hasn't been seen since ToJ so nobody would really know what he looks like, conveniently shacks himself up with a Lannister in the capital, named Bronn of the *Blackwater* (i.e., marsh water / brackish water), etc etc

"Hey all, so this is probably nothing, but i just had a crazy thought.

**Could Lady Stoneheart have co-authored the Pink Letter?**

Bear with me

From A Game of Thrones Catelyn II

>*'""He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and called him '""son""ù* ***for all the north to see***\*.""ù A Game of Thrones, Catelyn II\*

Why is that so special? Well, to my knowledge, the phrase '""for all the north to see""ù has only been used twice in the entire ASOIAF series. In addition, both times it has been used in conjunction with referring to Jon Snow as a bastard. This is one, but what is the other?

>*'""Bastard, was the only word written outside the scroll. No Lord Snow or Jon Snow or Lord Commander. Simply Bastard. And the letter was sealed with a smear of hard pink wax. '""You were right to come at once,""ù Jon said. You were right to be afraid. He cracked the seal, flattened the parchment, and read.*""*Your false king is dead, bastard. He and all his host were smashed in seven days of battle. I have his magic sword. Tell his red whore. Your false king's friends are dead. Their heads upon the walls of Winterfell. Come see them, bastard. Your false king lied, and so did you. You told the world you burned the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Instead you sent him to Winterfell to steal my bride from me. I will have my bride back. If you want Mance Rayder back, come and get him. I have him in a cage* ***for all the north to see,*** *proof of your lies. The cage is cold, but I have made him a warm cloak from the skins of the six whores who came with him to Winterfell. I want my bride back. I want the false king's queen.

"I think the strongest evidence that Bran will warg a dragon is his vision of a shadow of a dragon over Kings Landing.  There is a vision looking up at Drogon and another of the shadow of a dragon. Why would he have the vision from that perspective? When he time travels in the show, he is standing in the locations and watching as on outsider. The specific shot is a shot looking down at the shadow. I don't know which dragon or what it means, but it is definitely a BIG part of his story. ",SPOILER

"The Isle of Faces and the KotLT story. These two KEY things are missing from the show. And we all know they most likely play a HUGE role in the books. 

The KotLT story is a big mystery that explains something of Lyanna's and Howland Reed's motivations for what they did regarding the preparation for the Long Night and the Others. The details of these motivations and actions are untouched by the show. They will play a pivotal role in the books. 

No way with the mysteries of the Isle of Faces and Howland Reed's visitation are not important to the end game of the book series. 

So as the show tumbled it's way to it's own outcome with some of the story ideas GRRM gave them... they definitely had to bastardize the story to make it a fit for tv and so the audience accepts it. AKA the '""heroes will win""ù with still a slight hint of bitter sweetness. 

With all the characters alive in the books, yet dead on the show and vice versa... these key storylines and the OBVIOUS Chekhov's '""Island in the middle of the continent""ù will play a major role in the narrative of the series. 

So I believe though the tv series will hit a few broad strokes of the end game, it will not be nearly as wonderfully well written and thematically connected as the series will grant us. And YES, they endings will differ as GRRM is too impressive of a craftsman to give us a tv audience friendly ending like the show will have to deliver for the casual watcher to feel like their investment was paid off. GRRM defiantly has at least a few twists and gray moments up his sleeves.

"Throughout the series Martin uses a key word or phrase to tie an abstract idea behind the words used. I will be focusing on the use of Jon flexing his burned hand as a proof for future posts. Furthermore the phrase is tied to Jon's central internal strife, his 'human heart in conflict with itself'. Currently this conflict boils down to staying true to his vows to the Watch or his need to fight for his family and Winterfell. This is also tied to Maester Aemon's lesson in AGOT, who teaches Jon he should flex his hand to keep his fingers limber.

Jon has three enemies on his mind when he is preparing himself. First is against the greatest threat to the realms of men as he sees it: wights commanded by the Others. Second when preparing to fight wildlings North of the Wall. Last to fight enemies south of the Wall.

>""You do not look well. How is your hand?""

>""Healing."" Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him. He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow.

>-Jon VII, AGOT

The first time Jon flexes his hand is a reminder of his first fight with a wight. Every time Jon flexes his fingers he limbers his hand in preparation for, or memory of, a battle.

   >""I warned him,"" Jon said aloud. ""It was nothing to do with him, anyway."" He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers.

>-Jon IX, AGOT

While the connection isn't direct, Jon flexes his hand escaping Castle Black. In doing so he has one thought on his mind above all others: join Robb's war against the enemies of House Stark south of the wall.

>...but the wight had claimed Ser Jaremy, and the Night's Watch wasted nothing....

>Four empty villages, no wildlings anywhere, even the game seemingly fled. The haunted forest had never seemed more haunted, even veteran rangers agreed.

>As he rode, Jon peeled off his glove to air his burned fingers. Ugly things. He remembered suddenly how he used to muss Arya's hair.
His little stick of a sister. He wondered how she was faring. It made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her hair again.
He began to flex his hand, opening and closing the fingers.

>-Jon II, ACOK

Here Jon is thinking on all three archetypal enemies he must encounter. Shortly afterward we get this from Jon:

>""There's no smell to cold."" There is, thought Jon, remembering the night in the Lord Commander's chambers. It smells like death. Suddenly he was not hungry anymore. He gave his stew to Grenn, who looked in need of an extra supper to warm him against the night.

> ...He flexed his fingers as he waited, squeezing and spreading until the hand tingled.

>-Jon IV, ACOK

Another reminder of wights. Next, the wildlings.

>The wildling leader fixed him with an unfriendly stare. ""Might be you fooled these others, crow, but don't think you'll be fooling Mance. He'll take one look a' you and know you're false.

>And when he does, I'll make a cloak o' your wolf there, and open your soft boy's belly and sew a weasel up inside.""

>Jon's sword hand opened and closed, flexing the burned fingers beneath the glove...

>-Jon I, ASOS

Jon is threatened by Rattleshirt, the first of the wildlings to announce their hatred for Jon. Nearly every encounter with the wildlings in which Jon flexes his hand he is either directly threatened or feels a threat to his safety. This holds true even for a fight with Ygritte, whom he feels would betray him if she were to know of his loyalty to the Watch. Returning to his third fight with enemies to the South are Jon's thoughts on Arya.

>It had been so long since he had last seen Arya. What would she look like now? Would he even know her? Arya Underfoot. Her face was always dirty.
Would she still have that little sword he'd had Mikken forge for her? Stick them with the pointy end, he'd told her. Wisdom for her wedding night if half of what he heard of Ramsay Snow was true.
...
Jon Snow flexed the fingers of his sword hand, remembering all he'd lost.

>-Jon XI, ADWD

The chapter ends by foreshadowing Jon's fate at the end of the book:

>And Jon thought, ""Ice,"" she said, ""and daggers in the dark. Blood frozen red and hard, and naked steel."" His sword hand flexed. The wind was rising.

>-Jon XI, ADWD

Finally we reach Jon's decision to ride South and fight with the wildlings to take back Winterfell. When first fleeing Castle Black, Jon thinks that Sam should stay out of it. Jon fails to realize as fellow brothers, it is a decision they are honor bound to prevent. The second time Jon again decides to forsake his vows for family's sake. He shows a surprising lack of foresight this time as well and doesn't think on how the Brothers in the command structure will attempt to prevent him. He seems to think they will let him go so long as he leaves them out of the desertion, as with his first attempt regarding Sam. When he wakes from his current state in TWoW, he will have to make the decision a third time. This has been foreshadowed by Maester Aemon in Jon VIII, which is the chapter between the two uses of Jon flexing the fingers of his burned hand in AGOT

>Maester Aemon sighed. ""Have you heard nothing I've told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first?"" He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words. ""Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows. Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old. By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first.

>-Jon VIII, AGOT

Aemon is forced to choose three times, through the three phases of human life, and regrets those choices. Aemon directs Jon to choose better than him, to not regret his choices as Aemon does. As Aemon was tested on three occasions throughout his life, so will Jon. We've seen him flex his hand the first two times this happened, when fleeing Castle Black and reading the Pink Letter to leave the Watch.

**tl;dr**: Jon isn't going to be absolved of his oath to the Watch after he dies. He is going to break it , having tried twice already.",SPOILER

"I think Reznak mo Reznak might be Varys

Reznak mo Reznak is one of Dany's advisors in Meereen. He doesn't appear until the beginning of ADWD and doesn't have any history that we are told of. His advice is centered around making the Meereenese accept Dany as one of their own. He recommends her to ""wear her floppy ears,"" to dress in a tokar and show respect to the nobility of Meereen. He also supports opening the fighting pits and the mirage to Hizdahr.

What made me start thinking he is Varys?

He is described very similarly to Varys. He's heavily perfumed and is excessively flattering to his superiors. He is always wringing his hands just like Varys is constantly doing. And like Varys, he expresses himself with broad emotions, often pleading as if he is on the brink of despair.

Why am I not certain he is Varys?

Two reasons; Barristan Selmy's thoughts and actions towards Reznak, and Varys' presence in Kings Landing at the end of ADWD

Firstly Barristan Selmy, in his POV chapters, always refers to Reznak and The Spider as different people. It is possible that this is a situation where someone's name is changed even in thought (like Alayne), but I don't know about that. Barristan also never tells  Dany that Reznak is Varys. This seems like something he would do if he recognized him, seeing as it was him who told her about Jorah. It is possible that he doesn't recognize him, being a master of disguise and all, but Reznak doesn't seem like a great disguise given that he looks, smells, and sounds like Varys. I think it more likely that Illyrio told Barristan that he and Varys are planning a Targaryen restoration and to just keep quiet if Varys shows up seeing as Dany is probably still mad at him for sending assassins after her. Barristan also distrusts and dislikes Reznak, but that makes me think he's Varys more because that is how Barristan feels about Varys, and I don't think that would change just because Illyrio says they're on the same team.

As for Varys being in Kings Landing, there isn't much I can think of to make that make sense with Varys being Reznak. The two cities are very far apart from each other and the journey between them crosses treacherous seas being raked by autumn storms and swimming with Ironborn reavers, Volantine fleets, and Lysenni pirates. All I can think is maybe the epilogue takes place a while after the second to last Baristan chapter, which is the last time we heard of him.

I'd love to hear what you guys all think",SPOILER
"Edit: **Should be Munkun not** ***Munkin*** **in the Title**

##Intro

My favorite genre of fiction and film-making is noir: stylized crime films and books that came into prominence in American cinema in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and saw resurrection in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as neo-noir. Think classic movies like *The Maltese Falcon*, *Rear Window* or *Double Indemnity*, or neo-noir films and novels such as James Ellroy's *The LA Quartet*, *Chinatown* or even *Blade Runner.*   

These movies and literary outputs serve as inspirations for some of the major plots and characters George RR Martin writes in *A Song of Ice and Fire.* Ned Stark's investigation of who killed Jon Arryn in *A Game of Thrones* has been described by folks such as Steven Attewell as [noir fiction.](https://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/chapter-by-chapter-analysis-eddard-xv/) And I believe that GRRM integrated principles of noir fiction into his latest published book: *Fire and Blood, Volume One.*

In this history book, GRRM explores the moral ambiguity and cynical, sometimes outright pessimistic politics of Westeros, and he does so through a variety of means. Given my love of the noir genre, my favorite way he does this is through the numerous plots, murders and poisonings in the history. That brings us to my favorite sub-plot in *Fire and Blood, Volume One:* the poisoning of Gaemon Palehair, Daenaera Velaryon and possibly Aegon III himself.

So, draw the Venetian blinds, pour yourself a glass of gin (gross), light your unfiltered cigarettes and adjust the single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. King's Landing is a dirty town, and there's a murder plot afoot.
*** 
##The Poisoning

**Background**: Aegon III is King of Westeros: a country that has just concluded a horrific dance of the dragons which has left the country traumatized. Aegon, a broken, sullen and traumatized kid, serves as an embodiment of Westeros as a whole. Due to his young age, he's been under the thumb of various regents of greater and lesser abilities and morals. Recently, his first wife has died mysteriously, and he's remarried to ~~his half-sister~~ Daenaera Velaryon. His only friend is Gaemon Palehair: a former pretender to the Iron Throne who serves as his cupbearer and food-taster. Another recent bright spot for Aegon III is that his brother Viserys II has been ransomed back from Lys after having been a hostage for years.

**Scene:** Aegon, Daenaera and Gaemon sit down to enjoy a quiet dinner in the Red Keep as a saxophonist played *Careless Whisper* in the corner.

> Aegon was enjoying a quiet supper in his solar with his little queen, Daenaera, and his friend Gaemon Palehair and the dwarf was entertaining them with a silly song about a bear that drank too much, when the bastard boy began to complain of a cramping in his gut. (F&B, Aftermath: The Boy King and His Regents, The Lysene Spring and the End of Regency)

But this was no simple stomach constipation or nausea. No, ser. This was something else:

> ""Fetch Grand Maester Munkun,""ù the king commanded Mushroom. By the time the fool returned with the Grand Maester, Gaemon had collapsed and Queen Daenaera was moaning, '""My belly hurts too.""ù (F&B, Aftermath: The Boy King and His Regents, The Lysene Spring and the End of Regency)

The Queen and the Cupbearer were sick. Odd, that. Was something afoot? In King's Landing!? 
***
##Something Was Afoot. In King's Landing! The Investigation

> The knights of the Kingsguard at once descended to the Red Keep's kitchens and took a dozen cooks, bakers, scullions, and serving girls into custody, delivering them to George Graceford, the Lord Confessor. Under torture, seven confessed to attempting to poison the king""¶but each account differed from the next, there was no agreement on where they got the poison, and none of the captives correctly named the dish that had been poisoned.

It was evening in the city of sinners and saints, and Detective Munkun was finishing his thirtieth chain-smoked camel unfiltered. *One more week,* he thought to himself. *One more week until I can retire and pursue Lady Femme of House Fatale.* But then, a raven on his day off, called him into the office. Munkun immediately downed a fifth of gin, smoked through the rest of his carton of Camel Unfiltereds and then pulled on his tan trenchcoat and started his investigation. 

After successfully performing lifesaving on Daenaera but tragically being unable to save Gaemon Palehair, Munkun brought the food down to the boys at the lab for testing. Using the advanced scientific technique of feeding the food to rats, they discovered where the poison was placed:

> Afterward Grand Maester Munkun fed what remained of the supper to a cage of rats, and determined that the poison had been baked into the crust of the apple tarts. (F&B, Aftermath: The Boy King and His Regents, The Lysene Spring and the End of Regency)

Bernard, the head lap-geek, later determined the exact poison used:

> ""The poison used is called the Tears of Lys,""ù Bernard declared, an assertion that Grand Maester Munkun then confirmed. (F&B, Aftermath: The Boy King and His Regents, The Lysene Spring and the End of Regency)

Who would do such a thing as to poison the king, queen and his cupbearer? And who was the actual target? 
*** 
##Suspect #1: The Stool Pigeon and the Foreigners

In James Ellroy's classic 1988 novel *The Big Nowhere*, police are involved in red-baiting of suspected communists 1940s and 1950s Los Angeles. To the police, these leftist, possibly communist individuals are a possible Fifth Column, working on behalf of the Soviet Union. 

*Fire and Blood* has a similar structure in mind with the Lyseni family known as the Rogares are fingered as suspects in the poisoning of Aegon III. The Rogares were a prominent family from the Free City of Lys, and had married into the Targaryen family with the marriage between Larra Rogare and Viserys II Targaryen when Viserys was a ""guest"" of the Rogares in Lys. The Rogare stock rose high in King's Landing, but it quickly fell to pieces when Rogare power in Lys crumbled. It had ramifications in Westeros as the lords and knights around the Rogares began turning on them.

And not-so-insignificantly, the whispers were starting in King's Landing. It was the Rogares who tried to poison Aegon III, his wife and Gaemon. And they had a patsy: Hand of the King Lord Thaddeus Rowan:

> Lord Rowan's enemies at court""îamongst them many of the men who owed their offices to Unwin Peake""îwere quick to say that this was proof of what they had been whispering for half a year, that Thaddeus Rowan had sold himself to Oakenfist and the Rogares.

Prior to this, Thaddeus was seen an honest and true man. But now with Unwin Peake's allies spreading tales, Lord Rowan was arrested as a suspect in the poisoning. And then he confessed to the crime. Case closed, Detective Munkun could get back to his gin and carton's worth of cigarettes, right? 

No.

But Lord Rowan confessed! Sure, but he confessed under torture:

> George Graceford, to bring the prisoner forward. Manacled at ankle with heavy chains, his face so bruised and swollen as to be unrecognizable, Lord Thaddeus did not move at first, until Lord Graceford pricked him with the point of his dagger, whereupon he said in a thick voice, '""Ser Marston speaks truly, Your Grace. I have confessed to all. Lotho promised me fifty thousand dragons when the deed was done, and another fifty when Viserys took the throne. The poison was given to me by Roggerio.""ù So halting was this speech, so slurred the words, that some upon the battlements thought his lordship must be drunk, until Mushroom pointed out that all his teeth were missing.

And then when he was questioned more and more, he began giving ludicrous details about the poisoning. Gaemon Palehair, the only person who died, was behind the poisoning for instance. And so, Aegon III recognized that Thaddeus was innocent:

> '""This man is my Hand and innocent of treason. The traitors here are those who tortured him to bring forth this false confession. Seize the Lord Confessor, if you love your king""¶else I will know that you are as false as he is.""ù

And so, Thaddeus Rowan was dismissed as a suspect in the poisoning. And when the Lord Confessor was questioned, he introduced a brand new line of suspects to the mix.
***
##Suspect #2: The Mob Boss

In the 1997 movie *LA Confidential*, Mickey Cohen, a mob boss is arrested due to tax evasion, but an undercurrent found mostly in Ellroy's *The Big Nowhere* and *White Jazz*, Cohen incites all sorts of underworld violence and malcontent in Los Angeles.

Who better to play the Mickey Cohen role in our noir story than Unwin Peake: the worst person in Westeros at that time? A former Hand of the King who had used his role to advance the interests of House Peake throughout, Unwin was a shady, evil character. Likely ordering the murder of Aegon III's first wife Jaehaera Targaryen in order to plant his own daughter as King Aegon's consort, Unwin was unscrupulous at the best of times.

So when the Lord Confessor was threatened with torture, he gave up a lot of names; a lot of names connected with one particular individual: 

> It did not prove necessary to subject the Lord Confessor to torment; the sight of the instruments was all that was required for him to give up the names of the other conspirators. Amongst those he named were the late Ser Amaury Peake and Ser Mervyn Flowers of the Kingsguard, Tessario the Tiger, Septon Bernard, Ser Gareth Long, Ser Victor Risley, Ser Lucas Leygood of the gold cloaks with six of the seven captains of the city gates, and even three of the queen's ladies.

All of the named individuals were connected to Lord Unwin Peake either by blood relation, by appointed council position or were in the direct employ of the former Hand of the King. 

But why would Unwin want Aegon III dead? And did he actually want Aegon dead?

Perhaps Unwin didn't want Aegon dead at all. Perhaps the king wasn't the target. Maybe instead it was Daenaera Velaryon who Unwin Peake had put out a hit on.

If you'll recall from the quite bleak chapter from F&B entitled ""War and Peace and Cattle Shows"", Jaehaera's very suspicious death had resulted in the nobility of Westeros sending their daughters and sisters to King's Landing to vie for Aegon's hand in marriage. However, it was not an equal playing field. Unwin Peake, Hand of the King to Aegon III, had sent for his own daughter Myrielle Peake to present herself to Aegon.

With Myrielle, Unwin could put the Peakes into the royal family. Children born from the marriage between Aegon and Myrielle would have Peake ancestry. And to ensure that, Unwin was nearly successful in rigging the game to ensure that Aegon selected his own daughter. 

That is until Daenaera Velaryon showed up with her sisters to claim Aegon's hand in marriage. And Aegon, who was seemingly leaning toward Myrielle Peake, chose Daenaera.

Perhaps the Lord of Starpike planned to kill off Daenaera and try again to put his own daughter into Aegon III's marriage bed. And perhaps too we can see that the poison wasn't intended for Aegon given this line:

> Fortunately, the king had never been especially fond of sweets (nor of any other food, if truth be told). (F&B, Aftermath: The Boy King and His Regents, The Lysene Spring and the End of Regency)

Unwin knew who Aegon was, knew him to be a broken boy who barely ate, who didn't eat sweets. And if the poison was put into the pie crust as Detective Munkun had discovered during his investigation, it lines up nicely with means, motive and opportunity.

And y'know, it's probably the most likely thing, right? Unwin Peake has the personality and cronies to do evil deed to advance his own interests. He's ruthless and cunning and willing to murder children to get his way. F&B outright casts suspicion on Unwin:

> One name was never mentioned, though it hung over the Red Keep like a cloud. In The Testimony of Mushroom, the fool says plainly what few dared say at the time: that there must surely have been another conspirator, lord and master of the rest, the man who set all this in motion from afar, using the others as his catspaws. The '""player in the shadows,""ù Mushroom calls him. '""Graceford was cruel but not clever, Long had courage but no cunning, Risley was a sot, Bernard a pious fool, the Thumb a bloody Volantene, worse than the Lyseni. The women were women, and the Kingsguard were used to obeying commands, not giving them. Lucas Leygood loved swaggering about in his gold cloak, and could drink and fight and fuck with the best of them, but he was no plotter. And all of them had ties to one man: Unwin Peake, Lord of Starpike, Lord of Dunstonbury, Lord of Whitegrove, once Hand of the King.""ù

So, he's probably the most likely suspect to behind it all. But it's curious, right? So many of the alleged conspirators were questioned, and **no one** gave up the name of Unwin Peake as Mushroom recounts:

> But Peake had been at Starpike during the secret siege, and none of his supposed catspaws ever spoke his name, so his involvement remained unproven, then as now.

So in that light, I'm going to present one *final* suspect that I'll admit up-front is a bit more on the fringe side of things and is someone that is never brought up as a suspect, except for that one time ...

##Suspect #3: The One You Didn't See Coming

In classic and neo-noir, the resolution of the whodunnit mystery is typically resolved through a twist in the narrative. My favorite of these twists is from the movie L.A. Confidential in which [Spoilers for the movie which you really need to see. It's fantastic] >!Captain Dudley Smith, a respected officer in the LAPD was behind the Night Owl Massacre and was initiating a hostile takeover of Mickey Cohen's drug-running operation while the mob boss was in jail.!<

So, something that kind of struck me throughout the the mystery, the 18-day siege of Maegor's Holdfast and the ensuing investigation is that the mystery is never precisely resolved. Sure, Unwin Peake remains the most likely suspect. But it occurs to me that there was someone else in the Red Keep at the time who may have had a motive for killing Aegon III. Moreover, in his later years, the boy would become a man, a Hand, a King and ... a possible poisoner of his own kin.

I'm talking about **Viserys II.** *Duh, Duh, Duh.*

You're shocked. It's okay. Breathe deep. Oh, you're not shocked? You're rolling your eyes? Fair! But allow me to argue for this fringe suspect for a moment before you disagree as is your American right to free speech in the comments section.

So, Viserys' full backstory is a bit much to put into this theory. So, let's focus on the important parts to paint him as a suspect. He was taken captive during the Dance of the Dragons by the Triarchy's Fleet. He ended up in Lys as a hostage of House Rogare. And he ends up marrying Larra Rogare.

So, we have a Lyseni connection for Viserys. And of course, the poison is ""The Tears of Lys"" -- which to be fair, is not *only* used by the Lyseni, looking at you Littlefinger and the Tyrells with Joffrey. But it's an interesting connection, especially when you consider this stray line:

> Amongst the Lyseni, it is truly said, wars are fought with plots and poisons rather than with armies.

That line works as foundation for the accusations that the Rogares were behind the poison plot, but it also works potentially too in showing us the possibility that it Viserys who had spent much of his childhood in Lys too.

But that's not proof. Let's focus on motive. Viserys was returned to King's Landing at great fanfare. His return sparked real human emotions in Aegon. But ... their happy reunion lasted only so long. When a dragon egg was given to Laena Velaryon in Driftmark, it hatched! But, it also came out deformed and monstrous. And then it proceeded to bit a chunk from Laena Velaryon's arm. Yikes! 

And Aegon, who had witnessed the death of his mother via Sunfyre, was extraordinarily upset about this and had plans for the dragons and dragon eggs. But Viserys disagreed: 

> The news of this monstrous dragonbirth and its bloody aftermath were greatly troubling to King Aegon, and soon led to angry words between His Grace and his brother. Prince Viserys still had his own dragon's egg. Though it had never quickened, the prince had kept it with him throughout his years of exile and captivity, for it held great meaning for him. When Aegon commanded that no dragon's eggs were to be allowed in his castle, Viserys grew most wroth. Yet the king's will prevailed, as it must; the egg was sent to Dragonstone, and Prince Viserys refused to speak to King Aegon for a moon's turn.

So, Aegon wanted no dragon eggs in the Red Keep. Viserys was all like, *Uh, no.* The dragons were a means of vaulting the Targaryens back into power and prominence after the devastation of the dance of the dragons. Besides, Viserys had a dragon egg in his possession. He wasn't about to hand over his egg to someone else or be parted from it. But Aegon was king, Viserys was not. So, Viserys' egg was sent to Dragonstone. And Viserys was super pissed.

And then, the very next paragraph is when Aegon, Daenaera and Gaemon are poisoned. That's a damn interesting coincidence if nothing else. And then looking at it another way: the poison in the pie crust may have been meant for Aegon III, but Viserys who hadn't really been around Aegon all that much just might not have known that Aegon wasn't really eating these days. That's a stretch. I know. Just putting it out there for thought.

So, then turning to the pseudo-siege of the Maegor's Holdfast: when Lord Rowan was brought before the tower and made his confession, Viserys noticed that Lord Rowan was all beat up and shit and just answering ""Yes"" to every ""Was x-person involved in the treason?"", and he decided to use the opportunity to ask an interesting question of Lord Rowan

> It fell to Prince Viserys to make answer. '""And my wife, Lady Larra,""ù he shouted down, '""was she a part of this plot too, my lord?""ù Lord Rowan gave a heavy nod. '""She was,""ù he said. '""And what of me?""ù asked the prince. '""Aye, you as well,""ù his lordship answered dully.

It's a bit wheels within wheels thinking here, but given that Mushroom later writes that he got good ol' Thaddeus to confess to being behind the Doom of Valyria, it's very possible that Viserys sensed an opportunity to make himself look innocent by having a tortured, beaten man proclaiming his guilt. 

All of this is a stretch. I know. I know. But one final piece of evidence for your enjoyment. So, moving beyond the Regency of Aegon III and really, moving beyond Aegon III altogether, Viserys becomes Hand of the King first to Daeron I Targaryen. But when Daeron is murdered by the Dornish, his brother Baelor the Blessed becomes the king. And things don't go well.

Baelor had some mental health issues to put it delicately. And his pseudo-theocracy book-burnings and attempts to give Westeros over to the Faith of the Seven entirely was not doing the greatest of things for the Targaryen cause. When Baelor decided to make an illiterate stone mason the High Septon, yeah, it was not good news for Westeros.

But then, Baelor died, and his foolish actions died with him. Good timing. But wait. How did he die? Hm, let's check in with Maester Yandel on that count:

> Malicious rumors that followed in the wake of Viserys's ascension""îbegun, some say, by the pen of the Lady Maia of House Stokeworth""îsuggested that Viserys poisoned the king in order to finally gain the throne after a decade and more of waiting. Others have suggested that Viserys poisoned Baelor for the good of the realm, since the septon-king had come to believe that the Seven called on him to convert all the unbelievers in his realm. This would have led to a war with the North and the Iron Islands that would have caused great turmoil. (TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Baelor I)

It's fascinating to me that Viserys may have had a hand in poisoning Baelor the Blessed ""for the good of the realm."" Perhaps we can see Viserys' hand in his attempted murder of Aegon III in a similar ""for the good of the realm"" light. Regardless, Viserys' possible poisoning of Baelor the Blessed wasn't the end of the whole poisoning business for Viserys. In fact, as TWOIAF states, Viserys himself was possibly poisoned by his own son Aegon IV:

> It need not be said that some found the illness and its swiftness suspicious, but none dared speak their suspicion at the time. It would be more than a decade before the first accusation was put to paper that Viserys had been poisoned by none other than his successor, his son Aegon.
Is there truth to this suspicion? We cannot say for certain. But given all the infamous and corrupt deeds of Aegon the Unworthy, both before and after he assumed the crown, it cannot be discounted. (TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Viserys II)

There's a certain irony that Viserys II was probably poisoned by Aegon IV, his own son. Perhaps there's a deeper irony in that Viserys II was poisoned by *Aegon* after he possibly attempted to poison the other Aegon. 
***
##Conclusion

Again, Viserys II as a suspect is something of a stretch, and that's fine. The more likely suspect is Unwin Peake. But I think it's a fun mystery, and it's really not one that has a resolution. A lot of the people who claimed responsible or were accused ended up dying, but the poison plot is left ambiguous ultimately.

And that's one of the fun aspects of ASOIAF and especially F&B: the ambiguity of it all. So much of the history is seen from various perspectives, and the motivations of the characters are mysterious. And sometimes even the plots and actions aren't objectively known. That's the fun of F&B, and we can see George having fun with that motif -- especially as it relates to *Who was the poisoner?* from the Regency of Aegon III.

So, what do you all think? Who was behind the poison plot? Thanks for reading!",SPOILER
"I can totally believe that Viserys I was in willful denial. After all, the boys are his grandchildren either way, and he wanted Rhaenyra on the throne. Not to mention his character in general seemed to tend towards looking away from hard truths.

But what about the Sea Snake and Rhaenys? They went all in on Rhaenyra and her boys, and that would make plenty of sense if Laenor were really their father. But given Laenor's predilections and the appearance of the boys, it seems pretty unlikely that he was their biological father. So why would Corlys and Rhaenys back them so hard? I know they had no reason to love Aegon II or his crew, but even after losing his wife, Corlys became Hand of the Queen and kept his full support behind Rhaenyra.

Even after he broke with Rhaenyra and was basically forced into throwing his support behind Aegon II, Corlys went out on a limb and made it conditional upon saving the life of Aegon III, another of Rhaenyra's children- this one not even his grandchild in name. Did he ever believe that the Velaryon boys were his grandchildren? Did he save Aegon III because he was opposed to killing children in general, or did he have some other reason or loyalty?",SPOILER

"I was talking about that in another post (where I was floating the *small* possibility that LF doesn't even die in the end), and it got me thinking;

Do all the ""bad people"" in ASOIAF need to die/be punished/lose everything, for the ending be considered satisfying to you? 

If the person you root for end up on the throne/winning in the end, but a few of the characters you despise are still alive, how will that make you feel?

Are there characters that *absolutely need to die* for you to consider this a satisfying ending, anything else being an unfinished story/unsatisfying ending?

And do you believe it *will* happen the way you want, will all the important bad guys you hate dying, and only good people left alive?

And last question, are there ""good"" characters that absolutely need to live in your opinion, or it'll be a bad ending? (Or if that's how you roll, are there characters considered ""good"" or well liked that you absolutely want to die? Example, Arya could be such character, if you think the only good ending to the story of a child assassin is to end tragically, because it's not a fairytale).",SPOILER
"Here's a Mushroom-type tinfoil rooted from Mushroom's claims.

In [ConQuesT 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCaZWMppfp0), GRRM talked about it's fun to write Mushroom, because he always talks about ""who was sleeping with who, who poisoned who, and this guy was jealous of that guy, and the other guy had a very small penis.""

I have long assumed it's Criston Cole who's got a small member. But F&B revealed Mushroom in fact referred to Viserys! 

>'""What did Viserys ever have that she did not? A little sausage? Is that all it takes to be a king? Let Mushroom rule, then. My sausage is thrice the size of his.""ù -F&B, The Dying of the Dragons""îThe Blacks and the Greens

It's know Mushroom had a large member, but he never claimed his member was four times the size of a normal man (as [Tormund had](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1x7m99/)). Thus Viserys probably had ""a very small penis"". Therefore we can infer Alicent Hightower didn't love him for his impotence. Who's her true love, then?

>Strangely, in her final hours Queen Alicent spoke often of the Old King, but never of her husband, King Viserys. -F&B, Under the Regents""îThe Hooded Hand

The quote also makes us recall Mushroom's another claim that Alicent was Jaehaerys' lover in his last years. 

As a conclusion, Alicent subdued to Jaehaerys' superb art of love, and paid no mind to poor Viserys with such a small member. (When the sun has set, no candle can replace it.)

Where did Jaehaerys learn his skill, then? The answer is straightforward. Who better than the very author of *A Caution for Young Girls*?

>A somewhat more plausible tale is told in *Sins of the Flesh*, wherein Coryanne Wylde does indeed lure King Jaehaerys into her bed, only to find him fumbling, uncertain, and over-hasty, as many boys of his age are known to be when first abed with a maid. By that time, however, Lady Coryanne had grown to admire and respect Queen Alysanne, '""as if she were my own little sister,""ù and had developed warm feelings for Jaehaerys as well. Instead of attempting to undo the king's marriage, therefore, she took it upon herself to help make it a success by educating His Grace in the art of giving and receiving carnal pleasure, so that he might not prove incapable when the time came to bed his young wife.  -F&B, A Surfeit of Rulers",SPOILER

"These days we discussed on this sub how Robert's rule was legitimized using his Targaryen grandmother and wondered how set he was on making that house extinct. 

Doesn't that sound off? We know from history that brothers can be the greatest enemies and alliences through marriage often meant war within family. But still, I wonder. Robert's grandmother was Targaryen. Meaning, she was a very close family member, not some distant cousin. Did Rhaelle never visit court after she became Lady of Storm's End, connecting those houses? When did she die? Did Robert know her? I can't find any information on that. But I would find it strangely off if Robert as achild sat on the lap of his grandmother, a Targaryen princess, only to then want them all dead. He can hate Rhaegar as much as he wants but why the hate on house Targaryen as a whole? 

But then again, maybe he never knew her and thus doesn't really relate to Rhaelle. Not many young people in this story came to know their grandparents. ",SPOILER
"* __TL DR:__ Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and Carthage from 264 BC to 146 BC. Since then, these well-documented wars have been widely studied and they still inspire a lot of literature. Miguel Sapochnik, who directed the Battle of the Bastards, confirmed that the Battle of Cannae from the Second Punic War was one of his inspirations. In this thread, I will argue that in the books, we might see a battle heavily inspired by the Battle of Lake Trasimene.

* To get the idea, first have a look at how the [Battle of Lake Trasimene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arxEQh0qVZY) took place. Especially note where and how the battle was fought, starting around 2:49. This battle is still regarded as the greatest ambush in military history. Note the fog that greatly helped the ambush.

* Long Lake is the place I expect this battle to take place. The kingsroad runs along the northwestern shore of Long Lake on its way to the Wall. Just study the [map of the North](https://atlasoficeandfireblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/westeros-the-north.png) by /u/werthead and compare the northwestern section of Long Lake with Lake Trasimene. It is more or less the same battleground. It is a great spot to ambush an army from Winterfell taking the kingsroad. We have a very recent historical battle at Long Lake where the wildlings were encircled by two armies and the lake. Only a small portion of them could survive the ambush.

> Raymun's host numbered in the thousands, by all accounts, and they fought their way as far south as Long Lake. There, Lord Willam Stark and the Drunken Giant, Lord Harmond of House Umber, brought their armies against them. With two hosts surrounding him, and the lake to his back, Redbeard fought and died, but not before slaying Lord Willam.

* I have a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7sdab7/spoilers_extended_vale_knights_to_the_rescue/) where I discussed that the Battle of the Bastards in the books will be a reenactment of the Battle at Long Lake at the same location with some reversals and parallels:

1. The wildlings led by Jon will be the good guys against the Northmen led by Ramsay taking off from Winterfell.

1. Jon/wildlings will be the side planning the ambush.

1. There will be a fog greatly enabling the ambush as in Lake Trasimene. A small favor from the '""old gods""ù no doubt.

1. Hannibal compensated his losses while crossing the Alps by recruiting the Gauls who hated the Romans. Jon too is likely to have a composite host of wildlings, clansmen, Skagosi and even giants.

1. Unlike Hannibal or the Starks/Umbers, Jon will not have a capable cavalry, nor will his infantry/archers be as well trained and well equipped as the Bolton side. As a result, I think the ambush will eventually fail and Jon will find himself on the receiving end of the mailed fist.

1. The battle will turn in favor of Ramsay but Stannis will arrive unexpectedly with the Manderly cavalry to smash the Boltons. The melting snows will enable fast travel by boats through the White Knife and the fog will conceal the arrival of Stannis until it is too late for the Boltons. Some of the Bolton soldiers will probably break through and escape to Dreadfort.

> '""The Ryswells and Dustins are tied to House Bolton by marriage,""ù Jon informed him. '""These others have lost their lords in the fighting. I do not know who leads them now. Crowfood is no lapdog, though. Your Grace would do well to accept his terms.""ù

> Stannis ground his teeth. '""He informs me that Umber will not fight Umber, for any cause.""ù

> Jon was not surprised. '""If it comes to swords, see where Hother's banner flies and put Mors on the other end of the line.""ù

* For a long time I thought that Jon will rally the Umbers to his cause and have them fight side by side with his wildlings against Ramsay. But recently, I am thinking that the Umbers might not join Jon at all, or worse, turn their cloaks during the battle and attack the wildlings. 

> '""Your Grace, the Karstarks are taken. A few of them resisted, and died for it. Most were too confused, and yielded quietly. We have herded them all into the longhall and confined them there.""ù

> '""Well done.""ù

> '""They say they did not know. The ones we've questioned.""ù

> '""They would.""ù

> '""We might question them more sharply... '""

> '""No. I believe them. Karstark could never have hoped to keep his treachery a secret if he shared his plans with every baseborn manjack in his service. Some drunken spearman would have let it slip one night whilst laying with a whore. They did not need to know. They are Karhold men. When the moment came they would have obeyed their lords, as they had done all their lives.""ù

* This might serve as setup to the Umber leader changing sides during the battle and Jon failing to anticipate the betrayal. We know that Mors will die soon. After him, it is unclear who will lead the Umbers. Mors was the one willing to make an agreement with Stannis depending on certain terms. The next Umber leader might not have any terms or reasons to support the wildling army of Jon. 

* In fact, the Umbers might feel threatened by the Alys-Sigorn wedding policy of Jon, fearing that Jon will wed the daughters of Greatjon to the wildlings and they will take over the Umber lands. 

* Moreover, after the chaos following the assassination, some hard-to-control wildlings might start raiding and ruining everything. There is also the possibility that Hother and his men will still be with Ramsay who will set them against the Umbers in Jon's host, after which the Umbers in Jon's host might defect to Ramsay.

He tells Bran:

>!""The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands, and *what does any man see of life but a few summers, a few winters?*""!<

Which started me thinking on a sci-fi tangent about how a planet can have such wild swings and variances of length when it came to the seasons, within the context of our own scientific knowledge.

It reminded me of a sci-fi novel that has some basis on scientific facts:  *The Three-Body Problem* by Cixin Liu.

&nbsp;

There's an occupied  but otherwise unknown planet that has extreme climate swings and could run the gamut from burning hot to being in a deep freeze, but with habitable periods as well as unstable (earthquakes/hurricanes/tsunamis) ones. 

Someone on Earth figured out as to why. 

Quoting from the wiki:

>Someone wins acclaim by figuring out how the climate works: 

>(1) the planet has three suns, 

>(2) the suns have different kinds of atmospheres, and when they are far away from the planet's surface, they no longer function as sources of heat and appear in the sky as stars, 

>(3) Habitable eras occur when two suns are far away, and planet orbits the third, 

>(4) Chaotic eras occur when the planet is pulled by more than one sun, 

>(5) firestorms happen when two or three suns are close to the planet's surface, 

>(6) seeing three flying stars causes intense cold because it means all three suns are far away, and 

>(7) if the three suns ever line up, Trisolaris will plunge into the nearest one and be consumed.

&nbsp;

Albeit this is an extreme example, but could it be poaaible that the planet that Westeros inhabits is part of a binary star system at the very least?  

It's been years since I've last read *A Song of Fire and Ice*, and I'm only on the second book now, but I don't recall whether it was ever mentioned whether Westeros has only a single ""Sun""... Or maybe I'm just completely off-base and their world has no basis in our reality?",SPOILER
"The guy was a crazy lunatic, but his attack on Dragonpit was just too convenient with a perfect timing for him. It was probably the best opportunity to kill the dragons presented on King's landing history. Tyraxes death is especially telling, considering how dumb common folk usually are I think people would have eventually stopped trying, but the Sheperd told them to go by the backdoor entrance, like he knew the place or someone helped him scheme the thing.

Not only that, but he only mentioned the dragons as a target of the god's fury when he had absolute power over the people and the attack was actually feasible due to the weakened power of the queen, had he mentioned his intentions early of disposing the dragons the city's guard would have probably gotten rid of him earlier when they could. He knew what he was doing and did it thoroughly, this is not the kind of scheme a madman can create and follow.

Now I doubt the guy was actually someone important or playing with the maester conspiracy or something, if that was the case he would had escaped after fullfilling his plans, he instead stayed in a city that anyone with some wits would guessed whoever takes it next eventually would have killed him eventually. But that doesnt rule out that he may had been influenced by someone else, taught him the schematics of dragonpit, made a draft on how to proceed with the plan, how to handle the people, maybe have a septon put all this crazy ideas in his head, etc, who knows, but there is something very odd about the whole Sheperd situation.",SPOILER

"I'm far from the first person to notice the similarities between the way Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, gets stabbed by his men in his last chapter of *A Dance with Dragons* and Julius Caesar gets stabbed on the Senate Floor in 44 BC. But I think there's more to it than just a neat pun (seriously, whoever coined ""Ides of Marsh"" is a genius). I'd say that Jon Snow is to the Night's Watch what Julius Caesar was to the Roman Republic - its doom.

So, Julius Caesar was an ambitious man from a distinguished background with something to prove. Though ambition is far from Jon's defining characteristic, he desperately wants to make something of himself. He joins the Night's Watch for precisely this reason.

>""I forget nothing,"" Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller. ""I want to serve in the Night's Watch, Uncle.""

But what place could a bastard hope to earn?

>*A Game of Thrones* Jon I

Both Julius Caesar and Jon Snow were to some extant reformers. Julius Caesar as Consul expanded Roman citizenship rights to newly conquered peoples and made tax and land reforms that wildly boosted his popularity among the Roman people. Jon Snow as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch makes historic peace with the Free Folk and allows them to pass South of the Wall. 

However, both Caesar's Consulship and Jon's were nothing if not controversial. Caesar broke countless norms as Consul, from imprisoning a senator for speaking out against him to subverting Senate rules to pass his reforms... there's a reason that even before Caesar crossed the Rubicon Senators thought he meant to become an emperor.

Meanwhile, Jon allies with Stannis Baratheon, a rival claimant to the Iron Throne, breaking the Watch's commitment to neutrality. Jon *lets to wildlings South of the Wall*, even though he'd been one of the people leading the fight against Mance Rayder's army. Jon decides against executing Mance Rayder, instead sending him to Winterfell incognito. Though it's certainly the Lord Commander's prerogative as to who gets executed, Jon choosing not to take the King-Beyond-the-Wall's head  is absolutely a controversial move. Consider how willing he was to give Lord Janos Slynt the same mercy.

>*A Dance with Dragons* Jon II

Consider the point of view of one of the mutineers. Jon Snow had abused his authority to break almost every one of the Watch's norms. He'd not acted like a Lord Commander, but rather a King. 

*(Like the Night's King?!?!? Another Stark bastard named Jon Snow who turned the Night's Watch into his personal kingdom?!?!? One who was only stopped by an alliance between the King-bEyond-the-Wall and the King in the North, neither of whom are in a position to stop him?!?!?!?!)*

...Sorry about that. But tinfoil aside, the mutineers would likely have seen Jon Snow much the same way that the Senators saw Caesar. And in desperation, they only accelerated the destruction of the Republic/Night's Watch. So, Brutus(Marsh) and a bunch of other Senators(Black Brothers) surround Caesar(Jon) and kill him. Ides of Marsh n all.

>Then Bowen Marsh stood there before him, tears running down his cheeks. ""For the Watch."" He punched Jon in the belly. When he pulled his hand away, the dagger stayed where he had buried it.

>Jon fell to his knees. He found the dagger's hilt and wrenched it free. In the cold night air the wound was smoking. ""Ghost,"" he whispered. Pain washed over him. Stick them with the pointy end. When the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow. He never felt the fourth knife. Only the cold ""¶

>*A Dance with Dragons*, Jon XIII

In the aftermath of Caesar's death, the assassins had to flee to Greece because, well, Caesar was extraordinarily popular. All the reforms that he'd pushed through, though far from altruistically motivated, *did* give him a large amount of support. I bet the wildlings who Jon let through the Wall function in much the same way. I wonder if Bowen Marsh is long for this world. Though Cassius and Brutus survived the immediate aftermath, Marsh might not get the chance. If he does survive, though, he'll retreat, either leaving Castle Black or hunkering down with his fellow conspirators. I think that there's chaos until the Queen's men force some sort of peace and an election of a new Lord Commander. Jon was still relatively popular, so Marsh ain't gonna be the next Lord Commander if he lives (I think he doesn't). I think that the next Lord Commander will be very much the reverse of Jon, inflaming tensions with the Wildlings and the Queen's men, trying to reverse everything that Jon did. I think it'll be Alliser Thorne, last seen angrily going off on a ranging. I doubt we've seen the last of him. Either way, the mutineers and other Black Brothers elect the 999th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

Then Val, Mel, or whoever the hell pulls some fancy Red Rahloo bs or whatever and Jon Snow returns to the lands of the living. 

Before speculating what he gets up to, a brief tangent about Augustus Caesar, the first Emperor of Rome. He was known as Octavian at the time, returned to Rome as soon as he learned about Caesar's death. He took Caesar's name and became the new Gaius Julius Caesar. Caesar essentially left everything, including his name, to Octavian. This is post-resurrection Jon Snow. Augustus (then ~~Octavian~~ Gaius Julius Caesar).

I'm gonna refer to Octavian as Augustus, as he was later known, for simplicity's sake, but the fact that he took Caesar's name fits the idea of post-resurrection Jon as Augustus, in my opinion.

Augustus convinced the Roman people that Caesar had become a god, pointing to a comet that flew over the funeral games Augustus scheduled to honor Caesar. Remember from the show?

>""They think you're some kind of God. The man who came back from the dead""

> Game of Thrones S6E3? Tormund to Jon

Augustus pointed to Caesar divine-ness and built himself up, taking a shit ton of power. He took the Consulship and, with Mark Antony and Lepidus, fought the Assassins in the East. Not only that, this Second Triumvirate fucking murdered their enemies in Roman Senate, taking power for themselves. They beat the Assassins at Philippi, and Brutus and Cassius took their own lives. 

The important thing is that the story doesn't end there. Even though Augustus and Mark Antony were allies, there can only be *one* Emperor of Rome. 

The Second Triumvirate, Augustus, Mark Antony, and Lepidus (who doesn't matter for shit) split Rome up three (two, really) ways, but that does *not* last. Augustus fights with Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Long story short, he wins. Antony and Cleopatra take their own lives in Alexandria and Augustus consolidates all of Rome under himself.

What does this mean for Jon Snow? For a start, he definitely comes back to life. The Wildlings probably back him as he takes revenge on the mutineers. Like the Second Triumvirate did, Jon will take revenge upon Marsh. He'll kill the poor bastard who they picked as the 999th LC and take control of the Night's Watch. Not as Lord Commander, but as their King. After all, his watch has ended. (Maybe he doesn't. Maybe, like in the show, he leaves them there and goes South on his own. I think it works better if he dissolves the Watch, showing how death and betrayal has changed him, but the important thing is that he goes South.)

I think that what Jon does next parallels Augustus going to war with Mark Antony. Who is our Mark Antony? I think it's Stannis Baratheon, the One True King. Yeah, Mark Antony was more than a little indulgent with sex and wine and stuff while Stannis is... literally the opposite, but I think he still fits the narrative role. Stannis was a friend of Jon's, just as Antony was a friend of Caesar's. Antony also did a lion's share of the work in Philippi but Augustus got all the credit. Mark Antony was an experienced, battle-hardened commander, contrasting with Augustus' youth and inexperience. Mark Antony was also besotted with Cleopatra, a foreign... erm... ""seductress"", as the Romans saw her. Augustus definitely benefited from Mark Antony's reputation as bewitched by spooky forces. Sounds familiar?

>""Aye,"" said Big Bucket Wull. ""Red Rahloo means nothing here. You will only make the old gods angry. They are watching from their island.""

>*A Dance with Dragons*, The Sacrifice

I think that, without Rickon, Stannis isn't able to consolidate the North. In comes Jon ~~Snow~~ Stark, with Robb's Will giving him Winterfell and the North. Jon, who looks like Ned Stark and follows the Old Gods. Will Jon kneel to Stannis? I don't think so. That feels rather circular, considering he didn't kneel to Stannis earlier. I think Jon will take what he wants ~~with Fire and Blood~~ and boot Stannis and his men out of Winterfell. I think this is how Jon becomes KingindaNorf. 

This would be a darker turn for Jon, one where he gives in to his baser desires and acts selfishly. It parallels him with Dany, who's set up to go all *Fire and Blood* in Essos, and it sets him up for an interesting conflict with Sansa, who might take the Knights of the Vale North.

Incidentally, Mel is Cleopatra and Ramsay is Cassius. Ramsay wasn't one of the mutineers, but his Pink Letter was what set Jon's murder in motion. Yeah, I know finding one-to-one parallels is a fool's errand, but I think these work reasonably well.

Additionally, I think that Augustus taking Caesar's name could hint at  someone's (I think weirwoodleviathan?) idea that Bran wargs into Jon's dead body, but I hate that so I'm ignoring it. 

**TL;DR Jon is both Julius and Augustus Caesar, and their stories follow his rise to Lord Commander, his assassination, and rise again to Lord of Winterfell and King in the North**",SPOILER
"So, upon reading Fire and Blood, most of you have undoubtedly reached the same conclusion I have. Unwin Peake is an absolute piece of shit. He is first introduced to us simply as one of thirteen plotters who mean to eradicate the Two Betrayers for their disrespect(not for their betrayal or crimes against the smallfolk, mind you.) After the Betrayers are both dead and the Dance has concluded he seems a benign, yet grasping man. Of course, we learn to hate him when he becomes a regent. He appoints his uncle and bastard brother to the Kingsguard, and depending on what rumors you believe, he had Jaehaera Targaryen thrown from her tower. He also may have had multiple young girls harmed, mutilated, or gossipped about in order to persuade the king to marry his own daughter. Later, his minions have Lord Rowan arrested and tortured(allegedly without Peake's instruction) into insanity to sieze power in King's Landing. The plot fails, however, and Peake's old appointees are all either killed or arrested. Whether or not you choose to believe the rumors abount Unwin Peake is utterly irrelevant. The worst thing about him is mentioned in passing, regarding his children.
>Unwin Peake had married thrice and fathered seven children. Only one survived. His firstborn son had died in infancy, as had both of his daughters by his second wife. His eldest daughter had lived long enough to marry, only to die in childbirth at the age of twelve.

This short tidbit tells us everything we need to know about Unwin Peake. With most of his children dying young, this man was so desperate that he married his only daughter off as soon as she had flowered. If she was only twelve when she died delivering a child we can only assume that she was married off by her father at age 11, possibly even younger. Best case scenario and she had just turned twelve(that's middle school) when she was first given away by her father and died before her thirteenth birthday. No matter what, one thing should be clear. Lord Unwin Peake is one of the most evil people in Westeros history.",SPOILER
"My question is about how Jon's arc will begin in the Winds of Winter. Will he even come back? How long will he stay dead? From the time of his death up until the moment of his potential resurrection, what is he doing inside of Ghost? Resurrected characters come back different than the way they died, obviously. When they come back they have some defined purpose, they have an internal question of ""Why am I alive? What do I do now?"" So what will Jon put his life towards now? Does anyone believe that he will stay dead? 

My personal belief is that Rhaegar was Azor Ahai, Lyanna Nissa Nissa, and Jon is Lightbringer. His purpose is to now fight and die, and save life on Planetos as we know it. ",SPOILER
"So in A Game of Thrones, Edward hires Syrio Forel to teach Arya swordplay. There are a number of questions regarding him being chosen by Ned:

-How did he find or learn about Syrio?
-Why choose a Bravosi to train Arya?
-Why is Syrio in Westeros?

For the first question, the only info from the book is that he was recommended by someone, but not who it was. At this point Ned has few friends in Kings Landing aside from the northerners who came south with him. Likely they don't know any swordsman in Kings Landing, especially Syrio. That means it had to be someone who has been in Kings Landings long enough to gain such info through spies or friendships. 

The second question is a bit more difficult. King's Landing would have It's fair share of good teachers for Arya who were Westerosi. Ned would have easily been able to find a suitable teacher among the Westerosi. However, the person who reccomended him may have had a reason to choose a Bravosi. Maybe this person was able to sell Ned on this man's skill in combat and would be better suited Arya's sword and body.

As to who Syrio is in Westeros, he probably left Bravos after the previous sealord of Bravos died. This gives a reason to be there and is probably the truth. 

Now who is the person that reccomended Syrio to Eddard? Petyr Baelish, aka Littlefinger. To explain this lets look at the evidence. First, Littlefinger's family is from Bravos originally before coming to Westeros under Petyr's grandparents. Prior to that his grandfather was a sellsword in Bravos and his family likely retold stories of Bravos to Petyr as a child. More than likely, his family kept contact with others in Bravos, especially since they had a lordship in Westeros which comes with some political power. This all ties Syrio and Petyr to Bravos. Secondly, Petyr through his spies or ties in Bravos would know that Syrio was in Kings Landing. Petyr was also one of the few people Ned trusted in Kings Landing, making it likely the reccomendations came from him. 

Because of This, I beleive that Syrio was reccomended to Ned by Baelish. But why? 

There are two answers that I find plausible as to why:
-1 Baelish reccomends Syrio to have a spy neat Arya who make give up info that her father wouldn't. This is the most basic reason and doesn't have a large effect on the big picture. 
-2 Syrio was the Faceless Man that Arya later meets. Baelish saw the potential of Arya as an assassin and wanted to have her trained because it would give him a weapon in Kings Landing to spread chaos and give him (and Bravos) more power in Westerosi politics. This would also explain how (if SF=FM is true) he got from being arrested/killed to in the cart to the Wall. Baelish had a number of false jailoers and paid them all. Its Likely he used this leverage to get him out of the cells and going to the Wall. 

I'm not sure how accurate this theory is or if it'll hold up, but it kinda makes sense to me. ",SPOILER

"According to George, Arya's isn't pronounced like Aria, but with two syllables, are-ya. Her entire character arc is about identity and all the names she has used to try to survive.

"I was rereading the Tower of Joy scene in Eddard X, AGOT and I just had a thought regarding a reference about blue eyes.

>""No,"" Ned said with sadness in his voice. ""Now it ends."" As they came together in a rush of steel and shadow, he could hear Lyanna screaming. ""Eddard!"" she called. **A storm of rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky, as blue as the eyes of death.**

Here we see blue eyes being associated with death. This made me think of the Others, who are described as having blue eyes. First, we see that the Others have blue eyes in the Prologue of AGOT:

>**The Other** halted. Will saw **its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like ice**. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the moonlight running **cold** along the metal. For a heartbeat he dared to hope.

On another occasion in Jon III, ACOK, we get this exchanged between Jon and Gilly when discussing the ""cold gods"":

>""What color are their eyes?"" he asked her.  
>  
>""**Blue. As bright as blue stars, and as cold**.""

Though the Others themselves are not undead, they are heavily associated with death. For example:

* Old Nan refers to the Others as ""dead things"".
* Night's King's queen, who was almost certainly an Other, is described as a ""corpse queen"".
* They are capable of resurrecting the dead and bringing them back as wights.
* Melisandre believes that the Others are the ""cold children"" of the Great Other, an evil god of darkness, cold, and death.

So I think Ned associating blue eyes with death in Tower of Joy scene may be a result of the long tradition of the Westerosi, particularly the Northerners, associating the Others with death, whether they believe in them or not.",SPOILER
"Peep this GRRM quote: https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/12432

>George did mention there were ""various"" female orders of septas and the likes, and then he focused in particular on the silent sisters, which he specifically called them a ""mystic order"" who take vows of silence and tend to the dead. Then he switched to discussing the fact that of course Jon had now garrisoned some of the castles with women (spearwives) for when the Others attack. ""So we'll see how that works out"", he concluded. 

The spearwives, huh?

Spearwives are a uniquely Wildling thing. Warrior women in Westeros are as rare as - well, as rare as Brienne. Wildling culture has carved out a space for warrior women - ""spearwives"" - where Westerosi society recognizes only that women warriors are deviations from a norm, not a category to themselves. To see the spearwives in the role of the Night's Watch is a double deviation: women warriors replacing a male-only order. 

But Jon understands that he needs to break norms to defeat the Others. He can't cling to Westerosi norms - he's got to see the utility of every tool. He doesn't just need a sword to defeat the others: he needs a swiss army knife. When Jon comes back in TWOW, I'd be willing to wager that he'll rely on the military power of the spearwives in some way - even if they don't make up a huge numerical portion of an army, their symbolic power is clearly critical (I mean, Ygritte was a spearwife. There's a big connection here). 

You know who else has an army of spear-wielding elite warriors who defy standard Westerosi expectations?

Daenerys! 

Dany marches with the unsullied, eunuch soldiers. Time and again, eunuchs are associated with women by most Westerosi dudes (see Pycelle's comments about how poison is the weapon of women and eunuchs, or all the pointed adjectives used to describe Varys). Like Jon, she'll draw a core of her military support from a class of warrior usually mocked/ignored in Westeros. And again, it's a matter of utility: Dany needs a swiss army knife to take her throne (and to stop the Others, even if she doesn't know that yet). 

Jon and Dany are clear, obvious parallels in the story, and their Swiss Army Armies are going to be a big component of that. Their willingness to think outside the box, to operate outside the norms, is what will set them apart from the rest of the pack.

Of course, there's a dark side to this.

Enter the False Chosen Ones. Stannis Baratheon and Young Griff. 

Stannis is the false chosen one to Jon's real chosen one. And like Jon, Stannis understands swiss army knives. He seeks the mountain clans - a group of people Stannis has little respect for - because he knows that he can't win the throne without them. And when he burns Shireen in the books, it will be because he believes he must to it to win the throne (or stop the Others). 

Young Griff is the false chosen one to Dany's real chosen one. He, too, has a motley crew - the Golden Company's combined arms tactics (including elephants) are an exception in the world of Westeros. It's likely that Young Griff's victories in TWOW will be built in some measure on dead children as well - Tommen and Myrcella must needs die for him to secure the throne, and the Sand Snakes (another group of unconventional warriors) will be all too willing to lend a hand. 

What does that mean for Jon and Dany?

Well, it means it's not as simple as ""thinking outside the box."" It's recognizing the cost, and why the box might be there in the first place. Tywin Lannister thought outside the box too, when he offended gods and men by butchering Robb and Cat at dinner (and when he killed little Aegon and Rhaenys). Rhaegar tried to create the Chosen One by operating outside the norms of marriage contracts....and ended up starting a serious war. Varamyr breaks the rules of abomination, and ruins countless lives by doing so. And of course Euron Greyjoy gleefully thinks outside of every box he's ever seen, shattering norms just to hear them break. 

Jon and Dany have the creative thinking it takes to be the saviors of mankind. But to actually be a savior, they'll have to face some serious ethical questions about how far they're willing to go in the name of victory.

"I recently made a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9ygd21/spoilers_extended_quaithe_and_the_meereenese_knot/) about Quaithe's prophecy and how it reflects the Meereenese knot, where I also argued that Marwyn is currently the perfumed seneschal. There might be an evidence for this idea in an SSM:

[Permalink](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6539)

> *Now that we know how the ""Meereenese knot"" played out, what was the problem with this? For example, was it the order in which Dany met various characters, or who, when, and how someone would try to take the dragons?*

> Now I can explain things. It was a confluence of many, many factors: lets start with the offer from Xaro to give Dany ships, the refusal of which then leads to Qarth's declaration of war. Then there's the marriage of Daenerys to pacify the city. Then there's the arrival of the Yunkish army at the gates of Meereen, there's the order of arrival of various people going her way (Tyrion, Quentyn, Victarion, Aegon, **Marwyn**, etc.), and then there's Daario, this dangerous sellsword and the question of whether Dany really wants him or not, there's hte plague, there's Drogon's return to Meereen...

Note that GRRM counted Marwyn as part of the Meereenese knot, which is basically about people going to Dany.

> ""Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.""

Quaithe's prophecy as I argued is also basically about people going to Dany. If we try to match Quaithe's prophecy with people going to Dany as part of the Meereenese knot, there is no place to put Marwyn except the perfumed seneschal. Or else we have to accept that Marwyn is not important and therefore not worth mentioning by Quaithe (which seems unlikely).",SPOILER

"What always deeply appealed to me about Jon Snow as a character, was that relative to everyone else we were following in this story. He came from nothing and built himself up to become somebody. In a society that places where you came from above nearly every other aspect of that person. Being a bastard, even one of noble decent is seen in itself as a sin (as you were born out a wedlock) and thus like all medieval European societies (which Westeros is based off of). They treated him as such. It was only through his own personal feats of bravery and ability that Jon rose through the ranks of the Nights Watch to become the Lord Commander.

Similarly Tyrion has basically come from certain death (most babies with dwarfism were killed at an early age back then) to find his way in the service of one of the most powerful women in the world. He overcame obstacle after obstacle, facing nearly certain death each and every time. All because he was born into the unfortunate position of being a dwarf in an era where being so could be an existential threat to ones well being. On top of that he is doubly resented as someone in a discriminated class in a position of power. Which carries with it a resentment that is far greater than people who ""know their place"".

While this isn't to say that they came from nothing. Jon was still the son of Eddard Stark who raised him as his own child and Tyrion was still raised as the rightful son of Tywin Lannister. Both of which came a first class education and benefits far outweighing that of even a legitimately born commoner. It was their stories of coming from these very disadvantaged positions in society to make something of themselves that really sold their stories to me. These stories were something I deeply related to coming from a not that well looked on part of society myself to become a respectable business woman in high finance.

So needless to say when Jon was confirmed in the show as a Targaryen (and Tyrion suspected as much) was somewhat of a let down. While it would be an exaggeration to say that it completely undermines their character development. It certainly takes something away from it. Suddenly these dramatic struggles were not that of a bastard proving he was just as good as those born with advantage. It becomes, ""he always deserved the advantage and his success now in retrospect was pre-ordained as after all, he is a Targaryen"". In Jon's case it is so much so that he undermines the entire character development of Daenerys. Where she came from arguably a worse position (she had a name but literally nothing else), she similarly worked her way to where she is. But now she is expected to take second fiddle by fans because Jon is the ""true heir"". And in such a fashion, it is expected that he now rightfully deserves all that Daenerys has worked to achieve.

So as you can tell, I think it would have been best if Jon had just stayed Jon Snow, Tyrion stays Tyrion, and Daenerys stay Daenerys. They all have their beautifully crafted story arcs where Jon can still be the Prince Who Was Promised and Danny can still fulfill the prophecies without him being some unnecessary chosen one.",SPOILER

"Click here for Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ao8sq3/spoilers_extended_sansa_the_clueless_part_1/

The theme here is that because Sansa is not always aware of what is happening around her, the true meaning of what is being done and said is not expressed in her POV, and therefore is not readily apparent to the reader either.

So in that vein, I'll lay out the second, far more complicated, example of this: the dinner conversation with Lady Olenna.

I'll state that I'm a pie theorist when it comes to the Purple Wedding, and have in fact began arguing it on other boards long before PJ made his video. But one of the key questions most people ask after seeing that video is: if Lady O was trying to kill Tyrion through his pie, why was she asking all these pointed questions about Joffrey?

The short answer is that none of these questions were intended to learn the truth about Joffrey because Lady Olenna is already fully aware of what kind of person Joffrey is and what kind of husband he would make for Margaery. How do we know this even if Sansa is too dim to grasp it? Because everybody knows this.

First off, let's recognize the fact that Lady Olenna Tyrell is one of the smartest, cagiest players of the Game of Thrones in the realm. This is a woman who has successfully navigated her way through a hopelessly patriarchal society to become the titular head of the most powerful house in the realm. She didn't do that by being stupid or ill-informed.

Prior to Sansa's arrival in the capital, Lady Olenna already had three of her grandsons there -- Loras, Horas and Hobber. They would naturally have a contingent of squires, pages, stewards, servants and others, all of whom can be sending dispatches back to Highgarden on everything they see and hear, as can L, H and H themselves. Plus the fact that she had Renly in Highgarden for however many weeks it took to wed him to Margaery, and Lady O should have no shortage of Joffrey stories for her to form an opinion.

But even beyond that, we can also see for ourselves that everything that Sansa said about Joffrey is already widely known. Let's break it down:

First she says that Joffrey promised to be merciful to Ned, but then took his head and called it mercy. Well, that's no big secret. We saw when Joffrey first offered mercy: it was in full court, in front of numerous high lords and ladies, most likely with Horas and Hobber in attendance. Just like our modern courts, everything said and done in medieval courts was written down, disseminated and preserved for posterity. When Ned made his big speech about attainting Gregor Clegane, stripping him of lands, titles, etc., that wasn't just for the benefit of those in the room. He was reading it into the record so all the realm will know the judgement of King Robert. Aside -- don't ask me why Littlefinger is taking the minutes here, when it should be Pycelle or several junior maesters or acolytes.

So Lady O should be fully aware of how, when and where the offer of mercy was made. Then, a few weeks later, and again before a large gathering of highborn and smallfolk alike, at the Sept of Baelor no less, Joffrey declared publicly that despite the pleadings of his mother, his betrothed and the advice of his small council, he was taking Ned's head anyway. This was a major event that was on the lips of virtually everyone in the realm within a fortnight. The idea that Lady O would be completely in the dark here is simply not possible.

Then, Sansa goes on about how Joff is a monster and, later with Margaery, says he will hurt her just as he did to Sansa. But even if Sansa's initial beatings did take place in private, the fact that she is now appearing at court with bruises and bloody lips is all anybody needs to conclude that Joffrey is behind it. Nobody else on the entire planet could do this to the queen-in-waiting and live. But even if there was any doubt, they were removed following the Battle of Oxcross when Sansa was paraded in front of the court, again in full view of Lady O's own grandsons, and then stripped and beaten with swords.

So with multiple eyewitnesses to these events, including her own family, there is no reason why Lady O needs to learn the truth about Joffrey from a complete stranger like Sansa.

This leads us to an obvious question, of course: if Lady O already knows about Joffrey, then what is the point of all these questions? We can arrive at the answer by turning the question around a bit: if Lady O already knows this, then what doesn't she know that she can only learn from Sansa's own lips. I've already given you the answer: it is Sansa herself.

Look at it from Lady O's perspective. Sansa was born in the frozen north, where there is little to no interaction between Winterfell and Highgarden. So all Lady O knows about Sansa comes from official dispatches about name days and such, or whatever second, third or fourth hand information she may get from Brackens, Blackwoods or maybe a Royce. When Sansa arrives at King's Landing, she presents herself as the pretty, polite, dutiful daughter of Lord Eddard Stark, all full of practiced courtesies and shadowed by her septa wherever she goes. But Lady O is smart enough to know that the persona presented at court is not necessarily the real person.

So before Lady O can even think about making Sansa the next Lady of Highgarden, she needs to know: is she smart? stupid? honest? caring? Is she wanton? a schemer? a gold digger? Will she make a valued addition to House Tyrell, or will she be a huge PitA?

By asking these uncomfortable questions, to which Lady O already knows the answers, she can tell if Sansa is a good liar (answer: she's terrible) and how she reacts under pressure. Then, when Sansa finally does overcome her fear and speaks the truth about Joffrey -- and Lady O and Margaery exchange that look that most people interpret as the acknowledgement of their worst fears -- she can see that Sansa is not only brave, because the only time you can be brave is when you're afraid, but that she also has a good heart and is willing to risk her own happiness (having just gotten out of her betrothal to Joffrey) and perhaps her very life if someone accuses her of speaking treason against the king.

And it was right after that that Willas was put on the table.",SPOILER
"I'm doing a reread of just Bran chapters at the moment, he's one of my favorite characters and there's some many great scenes with him. So I'm curious, what are your guys' favorite Bran moments? It can be in Brans chapters or another POV's just as long as it's about Bran.

Mine is this:

*If the dish smelled especially choice, he would send it to one of the lords on the dais, a gesture of friendship and favor that Maester Luwin told him he must make. He sent some salmon down to poor sad Lady Hornwood, the boar to the boisterous Umbers, a dish of goose-in-berries to Cley Cerwyn, and a huge lobster to Joseth the master of horse, who was neither lord nor guest, but had seen to Dancer's training and made it possible for Bran to ride. He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them.*

He's just so sweet in this passage.",SPOILER
Who would've been the better king?,SPOILER
"So in the show the remaining Stark kids are Bran, Jon, Sansa and Arya. Jon isn't a Stark tho hes a Snow so he cant continue the bloodline unless hes legitimized (which I doubt is gonna happen) and Bran is a cripple from the waist down so I'm gonna assume he can't have kids. So that only leaves Sansa and Arya being able to continue the Stark line if their husbands take their name of allow their children to have the name Stark.

But yah the Male Stark line is extinct in the Male line once Bran dies unless Bran is able to have a kid somehow and if Jon becomes a legitimized Stark for some reason
 
So yah this was just a weird thought I had, hope they keep Rickon alive in the books I wouldnt mind seeing him continue the main Stark branch in Winterfell.",SPOILER
"I hate that **AFFC** & **ADWD** were never properly adapted. The producers were too afraid to expand the scope of  the story allegedly for fear of losing viewers when they are literally the most popular TV drama in the world and can afford to take bold risks.

It was recently announced that [Westworld's third season will most likely air in 2020](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/9/18218212/westworld-hbo-season-3-2020) which means that so far *Westworld* since its inception, will have released one season every two years. And yet it is still popular and¬† despite its dense & convoluted plot line, and ridiculously high cost, it remains popular. It keeps viewers invested.

I have no doubt that *Westworld* has lost a small but significant slice of its audience because it's too complicated and lacks sympathetic characters but not enough to prevent the show from continuing production and staying popular.

This is what is so hard about disputations, you have to balance pleasing casual fans vs hardcore fans of the original material. It seems like the former always wins. Don't get me wrong if it weren't for GoT it's very likely that I would have never read ASOIAF. However I still think it's better when an adaptation stays true to the spirit of the original work, especially if that original work is a masterpiece. Imperfect, incomplete, but still a masterpiece so far.

As some have said before, I don't think it was just fear of losing viewers that made D&D not adapt **AFFC** & **ADWD**. I truly believe they don't have a clear & deep understanding of the themes in those books, which is why they didn't really bother with it.¬†¬†And let's be honest many readers also did not appreciate the themes of those books. I certainly didn't, even though I didn't dislike them like so many people. The idea that **AFFC** & **ADWD** are the best books of the series is an unpopular opinion that falls overwhelmingly in the minority. However, **PoorQuentyn**, **BrendynBFish** & **The Mreereenese Blot** have persuaded me.

D&D could have done some research, they could have consulted all the great luminaries of the **ASOIAF** fan community, including the ones I've mentioned above. Hell, they used to consult **Elio & Linda** but not anymore apparently. They could have read the *The Meereenese Blot* but alas no.

If we only got 1 season every 2 years after Season 4, but it was going to be done right, I would have been totally ok with it, unlike some impatient fans. *Wesworld* is proof that it could have been done and this saddens me deeply when you look at how Game of Thrones¬† has turned out in later seasons.¬†It's the same network for God's sake and GoT is way more popular.

I also don't buy into the argument that actors can't be on standby for too long. Yes there is truth to that but the *Westworld* actors are doing it, If you were potentially going to be on one of the greatest TV dramas of all time why wouldn't you commit to seeing it until the end? Especially when you already know from early seasons that you're onto something very special. Do you think Bryan Cranston or Jon Hamm would have pulled out of Breaking Bad and Mad Men if their respective show runners wanted to slow down the production schedule in early season to get it right? I doubt it. So why would the GoT actors? Regardless, that's not the main reason D&D checked out of **AFFC** & **ADWD**.

Don't get me wrong, Game of Thrones made its mark in pop culture and that's wonderful, but there's been so many cock ups and it could have been so much better.

I can't wait for the animated adaption which allows more freedom with actors. Hopefully it will be better and faithful more to the book series.

**EDIT:  This isn't a debate about whether or not Westworld is a good show. I'm simply pointing out that if Westworld can remain popular with a slow production schedule, so could have Game of Thrones and in my belief we would have have gotten a better show out of it.**",SPOILER
"This is a follow up to an earlier post on [TPTWP](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a8amx5/spoilers_main_some_thoughts_on_tptwp/?ref=share&ref_source=link) that posits that Aegon I read the same prophecy as Rhaegar, believed himself to be TPTWP, married both his sisters to fulfill the notion that the dragon must have three heads, and conquered Westeros in order to unite it against the coming darkness... Only it was the wrong time. 

I have seen it argued that Elia was cool with Rhaegar abandoning her for Lyanna because of Dornish customs. I don't think that is the case, though I do believe that Elia was aware of Rhaegar's intentions with Lyanna, and may have been complicit in his choice. We *know* that, at least after the birth of Aegon, Elia is made aware of the prophecy. She may have known earlier. My belief is that Aegon the Conqueror and Rhaegar read the same prophecy that they must unite the Seven Kingdoms against the coming darkness. Rhaegar initially thought that he was TPTWP because of the circumstances of his birth, supported by Maester Aemon's observations on salt (tears) and smoke(fire during the tragedy). He came to believe it was Aegon, as he was born under a bleeding star (comet) amidst salt (Elia's tears) and smoke (probably from a hearthfire). If Elia and Rhaegar knew that she would never be able to have another child, and Elia believed the prophecy as Rhaegar had, then she would not only consent to his affair with Lyanna, but encourage it. What is her honor against the preservation of humanity? 

A Clash of Kings, Daenerys IV

>The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac.

>""Aegon,"" he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""

>""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.

>""He has a song,"" the man replied. **""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.""** He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. **""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. ""The dragon has three heads.""** He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.

A Dance with Dragons - The Griffin Reborn
>A bride for our bright prince. Jon Connington remembered Prince Rhaegar's wedding all too well. Elia was never worthy of him. **She was frail and sickly from the first, and childbirth only left her weaker. After the birth of Princess Rhaenys, her mother had been bedridden for half a year, and Prince Aegon's birth had almost been the death of her. She would bear no more children, the maesters told Prince Rhaegar afterward.**

The World of Ice and Fire - The Fall of the Dragons: The Year of the False Spring
>As cold winds hammered the city, King Aerys II turned to his pyromancers, charging them to drive the winter off with their magics. Huge green fires burned along the walls of the Red Keep for a moon's turn. **Prince Rhaegar was not in the city to observe them, however. Nor could he be found in Dragonstone with Princess Elia and their young son, Aegon. With the coming of the new year, the crown prince had taken to the road with half a dozen of his closest friends and confidants**, on a journey that would ultimately lead him back to the riverlands. **Not ten leagues from Harrenhal, Rhaegar fell upon Lyanna Stark of Winterfell, and carried her off**, lighting a fire that would consume his house and kin and all those he loved""îand half the realm besides.

What we know: 

1. Elia Martell was born premature and experienced health issues her whole life

2. Both of her pregnancies were difficult

3. She needed a long recovery after Rhaenys

4. Aegon was born in 281 or early 282. I believe he was born in 281 based on the above excerpt from AWOIAF.

5. Giving birth to Aegon nearly killed her and left her barren

6. After Aegon's birth, Rhaegar tells Elia that there must be one more, for the dragon has three heads.

7. The Tourney of Harrenhal occurred in 281

8. Lyanna Stark was ""abducted"" in 282

So either Elia was pregnant at the tourney or had recently given birth. This is fuzzy since we have no description of Elia at the Tourney. We hear only that Rhaegar rode past her and laid the crown of blue roses on Lyanna's lap with the tip of his lance. Personally, I think if she was pregnant, it would be an important detail and it would cause even more of an uproar than we hear about.

Now, consider the events of the Tourney at Harrenhal, the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree, and how they could shape Elia and Rhaegar's opinions of Lyanna. If we accept that KotLT is Lyanna, we view her in a stark contrast to Elia. She is strong and healthy where Elia is weak and sickly. Not only that, but she has a willful personality and a strong sense of justice. Elia's personality resembles that of Rhaenys where Lyanna's personality is more like Visenya, and Elia may have noticed this. Lyanna likely drew attention to herself when she dumped her wine over Benjen's head after he made fun of her for crying during Rhaegar's song. The way she was moved by Rhaegar's song and her passionate response to Benjen paired with the discovery that she is the KotLT made her a target for Rhaegar and perhaps Elia agreed. A strong and just woman would create a strong and just daughter, which she would want if she believed they would be partners with her son, the Prince that was Promised, in the fight against the long night. 

**TL;DR**
Elia Martell knew of TPTWP prophecy, and because she believed her own son to be TPTWP but knew she could not bare more children, consented to the union between Rhaegar and Lyanna.

"I have a two part question. The asoiaf books, to me, seem to be shockingly cohesive given the ridiculously vast amount of information given and the enormously detailed size of the universe. I haven't noticed many plot holes except, maybe one. So my questions are...

1. If Tywin harboured such a hatred for Tyrion, why did he not cut off Tyrion (or even Jamie and Cersei for that matter) from the riches of house Lannister? At times Tyrion speaks of his own personal money as well as the riches of House Lannister. Do we know what Tyrion did for a ""living"" prior to his positions at King's Landing? Why did Tywin not tell Tyrion that he couldn't just use the riches as he pleased?

"House Lannister of Casterly Rock is historically the richest and most wealthy house in the Seven Kingdoms and this is reinforced in their traditional house look. The traditional look of House Lannister is their fair, blonde hair and green eyes, the coloring of this look puts into mind the trappings of wealth.

This immediately puts into mind the Lannisters famous goldmines and how their how derives much of their wealth from the precious metal. Additionally, the most valuable coinage in Westeros is the Golden Dragon, giving them a direct association with currency.

The green eyes of the Lannisters are also described sometimes as being ""emerald"".

Emeralds were also often associated with Cleopatra, who was known to adorn herself in them. *(Sidenote: Emeralds are also associated with wit, eloquence, and fertility)*

"This theory just clicked in my mind. I apologize in advance if someone already figured this out.

In ADWD, Quaithe delivers this prophecy to Danaerys:

""The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.""


Now many people take ""dark flame"" and ""mummer's dragon"" to both be evidence that Aegon is, in fact, an imposter or a Blackfyre. If you've seen my conversations on this sub, you know I'm an avid believer that Prince Aegon is legit, so let's look over this prophecy *again,*

First of all, ""dark flame"". That easily can be read as a synonym for black fire, or Blackfyre, but that description fits an entirely different character.

Moqorro, the red priest with pitch black skin.

(ADWD, The Iron Suitor)
""The wizard was a monster of a man, as tall as Victarion himself and twice as wide, with a belly like a boulder and a tangle of bone-white hair that grew about his face like a lion's mane. His skin was black. Not the nut brown of the Summer Islanders on their swan ships, nor the red-brown of the Dothraki horselords, nor the charcoal-and-earth color of the dusky woman's skin, but *black.* Blacker than coal, blacker than jet, blacker than a raven's wing. *Burned,* Victarion thought, *like a man who has been roasted in the flames until his flesh chars and crisps and falls smoking from his bones.* The fires that charred him still danced across his cheeks and forehead, where his eyes peered out from amongst a mask of frozen flames. *Slave tattoos,* the captain knew. *Marks of evil.""*

Quiathe even lists ""dark flame"" right with ""Kraken"", or Victarion, as Moqorro is currently in Vic's service.


Next, ""mummer's dragon"". Danaerys, and even the audience, hear ""mummer's dragon"" and think of the fake dragons used for shows, and think this points to Aegon being an imposter, and therefore, untrustworthy.

I do think that ""mummer's dragon"" means Prince Aegon, but not in that way. I submit that ""mummer's"" here is possessive, not descriptive.

Varys, known for being an excellent mummer, is loyal to Aegon, and fully intends to put him on the throne.

(ADWD, Epilogue)
""""Doubt, division, and mistrust will eat the very ground beneath your boy king, whilst Aegon raises his banner above Storm's End and the lords of the realm gather round him.""
""Aegon?"" For a moment he did not understand. Then he remembered. A babe swaddled in a crimson cloak, the cloth stained with his blood and brains.""Dead. He's dead.""
""No,"" the eunuch's voice seemed deeper. ""He is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history, and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.""""

""Mummer's dragon"" could be a hint that Aegon is supported by, and in a sense, belongs to Varys. He is still a dragon through and through, but one that belongs to a mummer.


TL;DR: Dark flame means Moqorro, not Blackfyre, and mummer's dragon means Aegon with Varys in his corner, not fAegon.",SPOILER

"George RR Martin has made it pretty clear that he's a big Tolkien fan, and one of the things he loves about *Lord of the Rings* is the way it ends. 

I have to admit that the first time I read the Scouring of the Shire, I didn't get the point. The heroes had already destroyed the One Ring, defeated Sauron, and saved Middle Earth. Aragorn was King! Who cares about ~~Sauromon~~ (Edit: Saruman lmao) and the hobbits? We're ready for the ending already!

But after a while I understood the reason why Tolkien stalls the ending for this brief digression. This whole grand fantasy takes our plucky hobbits out of their comfort zone and on a wild, harrowing adventure. The Scouring of the Shire brings all the harsh trauma of that voyage back home, and it forces us to confront the fact that our heroes can't go back to the life they once had. That picture of innocence that we begin with, it's gone forever. 

So, what's *A Song of Ice and Fire*'s version of the Shire? I get that trying to do one-to-one comparisons between ASOIAF and LotR is stupid for a multitude of reasons, not least being that Gurm is writing his own story and not a Tolkien knockoff, but bear with me. What's the Shire in ASOIAF?

It's the Starks. The story proper begins with the Starks, with Bran - our version of Frodo - and his happy family in Winterfell. He participates in the old family pastime of chopping the head off of some dirty peasant while generally waxing about honor and duty. The Shire in Westeros isn't necessarily Winterfell - that gets Scoured by Theon and later Ramsay. It's the innocence and comfort of the happy Stark fam.

This is one area where I think the show is maybe setting itself up right for season 8. After all, don't the happiest season endings of the show involve the Starks together in Winterfell? Season six ends with Jon as King in the North, back in Winterfell with Sansa, and season seven ends with Arya and Sansa putting aside their differences while Jon and Dany... *come together* on the way to Winterfell. 

What's the Scouring of the Shire for *Game of Thrones*? Unseating Cersei from the Iron Throne, probably. After defeating the big bad and ending the apocalypse, our surviving good guys will probably want to bury their dead and stop fighting, but no. Cersei is still there, she betrayed the living, and someone has to deal with her. And so our surviving heroes, weary from war, have one last battle to fight, and I bet it ends with some of the Starks never going back to Winterfell.

I think that it's the Starks (probably Sansa) that rule Westeros in the end, but that won't be what we want for them. ",SPOILER
"So after playing a tone of CKII this weekend I wanted to talk about Rosby's Ward, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, and the six claims to Rosby. 

First and foremost there are only two characters who have ended up better off in each book so far. Bronn and Baelish, so it can be assumed Bronn is going to end up ahead in the Crisis, but it looks like it's going to be a decently sized subplot in WOW so I wanted to talk about it. 

Now for the six claims some of which we know and others we can make good guesses 
1.) Rosby's '""Ill-born""ù ward who is not Rosby's bastard and who is notable enough that Cersei remembers to be disdainful of him. More about his identity later.
2.) Lollys Stokeworth/Tyrion Tanner/Bronn- Lollys sister said that they'd be the next in line meaning that Bronn is sure pushing his adopted son or his wife's claim. 
3.) Perwyn Frey, eldest son of Walder and Bethany Rosby. One of the stand out examples of how House Frey could be winning the GoT if Walder wasn't so Walder. Walder nearly had a son be named High Septon, has another son who is the maester to a dying old man who another Frey stands to inherit. This is probably the best way for House Frey to get out of the Riverlands alive.
4.) Family of wife #1 this is a guess but since Rosby had two wives the first one might try to get a claim through her. 
5.) Family of wife #2 Tanda Stokeworth was this woman's aunt as well as Rosby's cousin. Whatever family is still there and established could be pushing a claim. 
6.) House Byrch technically House Byrch can claim that the title should have gone from Tanda to Felyse and from Felyse to any of her heirs through Balman which would be the head of House Byrch. 

There is also a possible 7th claim for Edmure Tully and Roslin's kid but I doubt anyone is suicidal enough to push that claim. 

So what I want to talk about is whether claims 4-6th are good guesses, who those houses might be (tinfoil clues based on appearance and details from the book and what have you. I'm leaning towards Blount myself.) and the identity of the ward. 

Note Falyse  says he is '""ill-born""ù but not a bastard or baseborn. This would imply that the ward is more of a poor lineage and circumstance than a bastard. Cersei even remembers the ward enough to know that he's '""not of Rosby's blood.""ù My personal guess is that the ward is a Darklyn of Darklyn-affiliate born after the Defiance of Duskendale. This would fit with being '""ill-born""ù and not being Rosby's blood. Perhaps a nephew through some relative or something. It also would still line up with what's written about Duskendale as its only stated that all the Darklyn's and their affiliates '""in Duskendale""ù were taken not necessarily all in the entire realm and the story of house Darklyn 7 knights on the Kingsguard and being so loyal to the Targs seems like a place where Barristan, Daenaerys, and Faegon's story could still turn. After all someone besides Darry and Martell had to be flying dragon banners. ",SPOILER
"Something I'm really curious about is your opinion on how Stannis would react to Dany's arrival had he (if he) survived/survives the siege on Winterfell.  
  
Stannis sees the throne as his right, and as his duty. He is hard but fair. His neutral but stern view pretty much defines him. So would he JOIN Dany or oppose her? Melisandre has a LOT of sway over him, and I personally think that Melisandre's influence (seeing the dragons) coupled with Robert usurping the throne, would make him come around and join Daenerys. I personally think he would bend the knee to her. However discussing this with a friend of mine on discord this weekend, he was 100% convinced of the opposite. That Stannis would consider the usurpation as rightious conquest with Daenerys having no right to the throne. Another argument would be that Stannis would probably lose all faith in, and maybe even have Melisandre personally executed after that fuck up.   
  
So yeah. Looking at who Stannis is/was. What do you think the most likely outcome between them would be when she arrived, if Stannis was still alive at that point?",SPOILER
"Why do Stannis haters claim that Stannis is inherently evil or only fighting for the throne for selfish reasons despite GRRM literally stating otherwise?

>   [And it is important that the individual books refer to the civil wars, but the series title reminds us constantly that the real issue lies in the North beyond the Wall.

You don't describe a character as righteous and fighting '""true threat""ù if you intend for them to come across as selfish and evil ruled by their desires and ambitions.

Have Stannis haters just not scene this interview? Do they just deliberately ignore because it goes against their view? Do they think George is lying? 

Need help understanding Stannis hate since the recent thread on him proved hate for him is as popular as ever.",SPOILER
"It's my first post here so this has probably been discussed before and if so I apologise.  I tried Reddit's search function and couldn't find anything but it's terrible so that doesn't mean much.

Anyway, I've been doing a reread and in AGOT we get the following line:

>When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.

AGOT, Jon I

I've seen some speculation that it foreshadows Tyrion becoming a king, him becoming Hand, or other things related to Tyrion's future.  But I don't think it's about Tyrion at all, I think it's another piece of foreshadowing about R+L=J and Jon being the rightful heir to the throne.

About a page earlier we get this interaction between Jon and Tyrion:

>'I am Tyrion Lannister.'
>
>'I know,' Jon said.  He rose.  Standing, he was taller than the dwarf.  It made him feel strange.

AGOT, Jon I

And then we get the shadow scene:

>'I don't even know who my mother was,' Jon said.
>
>'Some woman, no doubt.  Most of them are.'  He favored Jon with a rueful grin.  'Remember this, boy.  All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.'  And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune.  When he opened the door, the light from the yard threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.

AGOT, Jon I

Two clear references to height so close to each other seems a little much to be a coincidence, especially given what they are discussing.  I think Tyrion's shadow is being compared to Jon's height.  That is, Jon is taller than Tyrion and when Tyrion's shadow is cast on the yard, the two are of equal or comparable height.  So Tyrion is as tall as Jon, the king.

Additionally, they're discussing Jon's parentage and how people view him because of it.  Right after this exchange we get a somewhat random and out-of-place reference to kings.  They were discussing Eddard and Tywin, not royalty, and then we get a sudden king nod.  Not only that, but Tyrion is comparing bastards to dwarfs, and then Tyrion is immediately compared to a king.

That was my reading of the scene, anyway.  I think Tyrion's royal shadow is about Jon, not Tyrion.  What do you all think?",SPOILER
"It's interesting to me to try and understand why they are the way they are. Were they just born that way? 

I'm no Sigmund Freud but my take with Joffrey is that he failed to live up to the masculine ideal of his 'father' Robert, and so this generated self hatred, which he addressed by being cruel in whatever ways he could. Also, with his mother being how she is and her coddling of and over protectiveness towards him, that didn't help either. 

Cersei is harder to understand. Of course there's the prophecy by Maggy the Frog which has affected her for a long time. But she seems to just be a terrible, terrible person regardless. I'm sort of clueless about her, but maybe she's just trying to be like Tywin and this is the result. ",SPOILER
"I think Jon's decision to wed Alys Karstark to Sigorn should have significant ramifications. In fact, I think this was originally one of the things Stannis would do during the 5 year gap which would have alienated the Northmen to him. After the gap was scrapped, I think GRRM gave this role to Jon for better drama. Considering Harrion Karstark is as good as dead, this wedding makes it look like Jon giftwrapped Karstark lands to the wildlings. The Northmen should not fail to note this.

Umber hatred for the wildlings is well known. Greatjon is not expected to be set free. I think this move might cost Jon the Umbers. Crowfood and his green boys won't survive for long. Whoresbane is still on the Bolton side. In the upcoming conflict between Jon and Ramsay, Umbers might either stay neutral or even fight at the Bolton side.",SPOILER
"For instance: Roose hunting wolves, show Tywin gutting a stag, show Tywin fishing before the Red Wedding, etc.",SPOILER
"In the HBO episode titled 'The Door', they show origin of Hodor's name: Bran visits Winterfell of the past, meanwhile Bran's physical location, Bloodraven's cave beyond the Wall gets attacked by Others. Bran inadvertently wargs into young Hodor in Winterfell instead of present-day Hodor. This creates a connection between past and present through which young Hodor watches/experiences his own death from the future, causing the trauma that affects him forever afterward. 

More than conventional time 'travel', what happened here was people from two different times interacting with each other. And this happened when Bran is seeing the past. Bran has been looking into the past in various occasions in book and the show. In the books we have only so far seen him see the past through weirwood visions. In the Theon chapters, we have also seen him look at the present, once in Winterfell via heart tree and once in the crofters village via ravens. However, we don't know which time in Bran's life does this happen, so Bran could be seeing this in *his* past, present, or future (though present makes more sense). 

***If Bran could connect young Hodor to the future, could other seers do the same?*** Especially since there is a 'fire' analogy for nearly every 'ice' thing in the series. Song of Ice and Fire. Land of always Winter and Land of long Summer. Ice wights and fire wights (GRRM used that term to describe Beric). 

The problem with fire seers like Melisandre, Moqorro and Thoros is that they speak in riddles and their visions are more symbolic. Example: *Dragons old and young, true and false, bright and dark*. Or is that really so? In our only fire seer PoV Melisandre sees a grey girl on a dying horse and it was really Alys Karstark. She sees some towers which she interprets as Eastwatch but the readers think it is some other place she doesn't know, like Hightower or Pyke. Thoros sees Riverrun taken by Lannisters. But the subjects of the vision does not see the seer. When Theon prays to the heart tree of Winterfell and hears Bran speak his name, Theon isn't trying to See anything, he is just praying. But Bran replies and Theon hears Bran. We don't see the Lannisters or Alys Karstark or any *subject* of a fire vision realizing that they are being watched, unlike Theon and young Hodor do. There are two possible exceptions:

1. Varys hearing a voice from the flames during the ritual sacrifice using his 'parts'. Varys wasn't trying to see anything in the fire. Maybe the person on the other end was seeing Varys? But maybe the sorcerer was trying to see things in the fire and Varys saw like Stannis and Davos saw things in Melisandre's fire. 

2. Dany's visions of Quaithe. The only time Dany really sees Quaithe (ie other people also seeing Quaithe, confirming Quaithe's physical presence with Dany) is when they meet in Qarth. But when Quaithe gives the 'Soon comes the pale mare...' prophecy, no one but Dany sees her. It is widely assumed that Quaithe has a glass candle and that is how she is communicating/sending visions to Dany. And glass candles are compared to Palantirs of LotR. In LotR, Palantirs are like walkie-talkies or phones. But be it Palantirs or smartphones, for two people to communicate through it, *both* people will need one each. Quaithe may have a glass candle, but *Dany* doesn't. 

If glass candles can be used to send visions to someone who doesn't have a candle, do they work as Valyrian weirwood? We already know they kinda do that, allowing Marwyn to see so much about Sam and Quaithe to see Dany's future that she warned about. And if they can perform some of the functions of weirwood tree, could there be an incident where the person being watched ends up seeing the surroundings of the Seer? Dany seeing Quaithe is more similar to Theon hearing Bran. Like Quaithe was sending a message to Dany, Bran was trying to send a message to Theon. Neither Dany nor Theon saw Quaithe's and Bran's surroundings. But young Hodor did. Multiple factors contributed to it: A version of Hodor was present with Bran, and Bran tried warg into some version of Hodor. But that still could happen in the fire visions in the coming books. Or maybe it has happened before (Summerhall?) What do you think of the possibilities?

" This theory is here to put to bed the links between the Night King, Bran Stark and Jon Snow (based on the TV show interpretation).  

&#x200B;

Geroge RR Martins story is loosely based on the old English wars and English/celtic/welsh myths. The myths of Merlin, King Arthur and the legend of Bran and the cauldron are key to this part of the puzzle. I strongly believe that this story will end in a loop which involves Brans mind scattering across the ages as an influencer of the two true gods; the lord of light and the great other. These interferences by bran will cause, rather than prevent, wars among men throughout the ages, as the information he channels to them leads to madness and obsession.  

&#x200B;

To begin with, Merlins origin story and later involvement with King Arthur play perfectly into the character arcs of the Night King, Jon Snow and Bran Stark. In the beginning, Merlin, the wizard of Britain, came about as the kings of England decreed a bastard be sacrificed to protect their fortress from invasion (Invasion of the first men). During the search, the kings advisors came across a group of children playing in the forest (cutting down trees to find the children of the forest). One child sat in isolation from the others, confirmed as merlin, who was born a bastard due to demonic inception of his mother (night king). Merlin was found to possess greensight, worging and the ability to reincarnate himself with each passing generation (explanation below).  

&#x200B;

During his travels merlin proclaimed and instigated the start of the battle between the red and white dragons. The red dragon (men) he confirmed was England, whilst the white dragon (white walkers) was the invaders. Merlin prophesised that the two dragons would remain at war until a great leader, King Arthur (jon snow), arise to unite the land and make peace. Merlin later spent many years wondering the land and created a great monument and used his magic horn to move stones and build it (the wall). Later, a besotted british king (Rhaegar Targareon) asked merlin to cast a spell so a married women (Liana Stark) would go to bed with him. Merlin (Night King/Bran) agreed but on one condition that the child, King arthur (Jon snow), be promised to them (Prince prophecy). Merlin raised Arthur until his betral and later died but not in the conventional sense, rather trapped inside a tree (Bran will be lost inside a werwood tree).  

&#x200B;

There are three true gods in the GOT, the great other, the lord of light and bran the raven. Brans dissemination into god status occurs when his mind and body completely separate into the werwood trees after his physical death. In this instance, he becomes trapped merely as a voice communicating the whims of these two gods to the people who hear him speak. In this sense, Bran is NOT the lord of light or the Night King, but instead he is an influencer, trying to inform the living through the flames and within the mind of the night king about ways in which to prepare for war and prevent death and reunite peace.  However, whilst his influencing led to people called Bran building the wall, winterfell and other magical monuments, his words are also often misinterpreted, as shown by the madness of king aeryes or the obsession of sacrifice performed by red priests.   

&#x200B;

The final act of Bran involves the night king directly, who is also influenced by Bran. His one true purpose is to kill Bran stark before Bran attempts to change the past. Based on the vision of night kings inception its clear that Bran is involved in this point of the story. The TV show reflects this in the similarity in the clothes the night king and bran wears, the way bran flintches as the dragon glass is pierced into the unknown characters chest and leaf refers to bran being as big and issue as the men for which the night king was created to protect them against. I believe that the night king was originally a child of the forest (the alienated bastard depicted in Merlin) whom Bran will later learn is the actual night king. This vision will most likely occur in the godseye as  this was the site of the birth of the night king, and most likely have the most accurate evidence of the events available to bran. It also explains why the others keep leaving godseye symbols everywhere. However, the moment that Bran sacrifices himself by warging into the night king, brans physical body is slayed by the present night king and Bran is forever lost to his vision. The irony of this is that past bran and present night king will never realise that these events are looped; as the ink is already dry. These events, the fact that Bran lost his friends whilst wandering in the woods and broke his spine (sword) suggest that bran also fits the lore of the last hero. It also explains why old nan described Brans birth as the end of the long summer and why the three eyed raven and jojen are fixated on protecting Bran prior to his knowledge of the events ahead of him. Because ultimately, when Bran is born in the present, the night king awakens and builds an army to hunt him down.  

&#x200B;

Regarding jon snow aka. King Arthur, a song of ice and fire I refer to that famous line in the show '""promise me ned""ù. I don't believe that this promise is entirely based on the identity of jon snow as the true king, but rather neds promise to liana that jon would be a peace offering to the others to unite dragons of ice and fire (like King Arthurs white and red dragons). It would also explain why drogon likes Jon and why the lord of light (influenced by Bran Stark) do not want jon to die just yet.

"So, we know that >40,000 rebels clashed with ~40,000 royalists at the Trident. But do we know much of other forces? Obviously there's Stannis and his men, and an unspecified number of Reachmen at Storm's End/the Stormlands. Were other Storm Lords trapped in their castles with small armies too? Were there other rebel armies in different locations in general, beyond the force that fought at the Trident?

How was the Battle of the Trident so definitive if the Reach still presumably had at least half a hundred thousand men left? The Crownlands was probably pretty wiped, but I imagine Dorne still probably had a decent amount of men left too. We know that Lewyn Martell went to his death at the Trident, with 10,000 Dornishmem following him, but we don't know how many of them perished and presumably the Dornish still had some of their 30,000-50,000 spears remaining at home, that hadn't been killed in war.

So, it seems like to me that the REAL defining moment was when Tywin Lannister sent 12,000 troops to sack King's Landing, thus committing his ~40,000 troops to the rebel cause. Not the Trident. Is that wrong?",SPOILER

The main gripe I have with show versus book is with the manner in which the reasoning behind Robert's Rebellion was described. The show claims Robert went to war because his beloved Lyanna Stark was raped and murdered by Rhaegar. In actuality the Kingdom was overthrown because the Mad King was simply evil and enjoyed murdering his subjects. The linked article shows that the original pilot had a scene where Brandon and Rikkon Stark were tortured and killed by Aerys. This was the final straw that prompted Robert, Eddard, and Jon Arryn to begin the rebellion. Season 7's ""Robert's Rebellion was based on a lie"" upon the revelation that Rhaegar married Lyanna is utter BS.",SPOILER

And it'll be a mirror image reflection of his boyhood duel with Brandon, where he didn't yield, and his life was spared due to Catlyn's pleas.

"I'm not an expert of TWOIAF, so I need some help to figure this out.

I noticed something strange today. Do we know of any normal earthquakes on Planetos? As far as I know there are only the Doom of Valyria and the breaking of the Arm of Dorne but those seem to be rooted in magic than in planetary tectonic.

I searched wiki and reddit. All about earthquakes I could find are either linked to this two events or the Horn of Winter. Is the word ""Earthquake"" even mentioned in the books somewhere? ""Earthgiants"" is used. I read my german version of Dances with Dragons where the Doom is described and the german word for earthquake is not used at all.

All of this leads me to a theory: There are no normal earthquakes in Planetos. The people in westeros does not seem to know what an earthquake is because it's such a rare event. If this is true, we might be able to assume more facts about Planetos.

We know Planetos is round. There is a moon, a sun and stars. So I think we can assume that Planetos is inside a solar system like our world. A lack of earthquakes leads to the assumption that there might be almost to none mantle convection inside the planet Planetos at all.

This would be a huge deal. If the core of Planetos is colder than our earth, we would have no rotating core of iron in the core, therefore Planetos would not have a magnetic field. Without a magnetic field the solar wind from the sun would blow the atmosphere off the planet (Mars in our solar system has the same problem). There must be another explanation about what protects Planetos from the solar wind

Volcanos could still be working. There does not seem to be something similar to a ""pacfific rim"" on Planetos. Volcanos seem randomly placed but could still be working with a colder planet core. You only need to dig a very deep hole in the ground in order to get a working volcano. So maybe every volcano we know of could be created by magic. If there is no convection, those volcanos would not extinguish or ""wander"" - creating new islands like in Iceland on our earth.

So as far as I can think of, the killers for my theory are as follows:

\- An earthquake region throughout Planetos (like mediterranian region in europe or San Andreas Fault in western USA)

\- Wandering Volcanos (Like Hawaii or Iceland)

If the theory is not debunked, it might help us getting closer to solve the mysteries of Planetos.",SPOILER

"Okay, that title might be a *tad* overboard. There's not a lot about the Bastard of Bolton that can be described as '""soft""ù 

However, re-reading Dance, I was struck by the following exchange between Lady Dustin and Theon as they descend into the Crypts, 

> ""Roose is not pleased. Tell your bastard that.""

> *He is not my bastard*, he wanted to say, but another voice inside him said, *He is, he is. Reek belongs to Ramsay, and Ramsay belongs to Reek. You must not forget your name.* 

This passage got me thinking about the relationship between Ramsey and Reek in a way I hadn't considered before. 

Earlier from Roose, we hear of the origin of Ramsey's relationship with the original Reek.

> No one could stand to be near him, so he slept with the pigs ""¶ until the day that Ramsay's mother appeared at my gates to demand that I provide a servant for my bastard, who was **growing up wild and unruly. I gave her Reek. It was meant to be amusing, but he and Ramsay became inseparable**. I do wonder, though ""¶ was it Ramsay who corrupted Reek, or Reek Ramsay?"" His lordship glanced at the new Reek with eyes as pale and strange as two white moons.


(Emphasis is mine again) 

Reek was more than just a servant, he was also a master-of-arms of sorts to young Ramsey. 

> ""Bulls are strong. Bears. I have seen my bastard fight. He is not entirely to blame. Reek was his tutor, the first Reek, and Reek was never trained at arms. 


He has no training but he is still fulfilling the same role for Ramsey that Ser Rodrik did for the Stark boys. 

The relationship between Ramsey and Reek reminds me very much of the relationship between another wild and unruly boy and his sworn sword. Joffrey and the Hound. 

Cersei tells us this about that relationship,

> Joff had been fond of the Hound, to be sure, but that was not friendship. **He was looking for the father he never found in Robert**


*Reek was the closest thing that Ramsey ever had to a father*. Okay Ramsey left him to die, he *is* a sadistic psychopath after all (or maybe the story we have of Ramsey '""tricking""ù Reek is not entirely true. Reek may have willingly sacrificed himself). But the particular method of punishment he dishes out to Theon makes me think he (probably subconsciously) grieves for Reek and misses him badly. 

He does seem to have an unusually strong attachment to Theon. When Roose takes him just before Arya's wedding, he seems genuinely upset and far angrier than he should be. 

This takes us back to the original quote. 

> *He is, he is. Reek belongs to Ramsay, and Ramsay belongs to Reek. You must not forget your name*


Theon has just realised that Ramsey is as much his as he is Ramsey's. The proof of this is his name. Reek might just be the only person Ramsey has ever cared about. Ramsey *needs* Reek.

"Before Robert's Rebellion began, Brandon Stark was betrothed to Catelyn Tully whilst his younger brother, Eddard, remained single and had taken a liking to Ashara Dayne upon their first meeting at the Tourney of Harrenhal.

> ""Tell me.""
He looked at her uncomfortably. ""My aunt Allyria says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at Harrenhal""î""
""That's not so. He loved my lady mother.""

At Harrenhal, Ashara had danced with several notable Westerosi individuals, including Barristan Selmy, Oberyn Martell, Jon Connignton and finally Eddard Stark.

The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword, a red snake, and the lord of griffins, and lastly with the quiet wolf . . . but only after the wild wolf spoke to her on behalf of a brother too shy to leave his bench.

At some point during this tourney, Ashara had developed feelings for one of the Stark brothers and became sexually involved with them;

Once Rickard and Brandon Stark were killed by Aerys II however, Ned was obligated by the customs of Westeros to marry Catelyn because she was his elder brother's betrothed, just as Tommen was obligated to marry Margaery, Joffrey's betrothed before he died. As we know, Ned willingly married Catelyn and fathered a child in Robb before he left to go to war with Robert and Jon Arryn. He willingly kept his family's honour and vows in-tact.

Compare this in contrast to Robb, who is betrothed to marry a granddaughter of Walder Frey yet ends up marrying Jeyne Westerling after having sexual intercourse with her and 'dishonouring her.'

>""I took her castle and she took my heart."" Robb smiled. ""The Crag was weakly garrisoned, so we took it by storm one night. Black Walder and the Smalljon led scaling parties over the walls, while I broke the main gate with a ram. I took an arrow in the arm just before Ser Rolph yielded us the castle. It seemed nothing at first, but it festered. Jeyne had me taken to her own bed, and she nursed me until the fever passed. And she was with me when the Greatjon brought me the news of . . . of Winterfell. Bran and Rickon."" He seemed to have trouble saying his brothers' names. ""**That night, she . . . she comforted me, Mother.**""
Catelyn did not need to be told what sort of comfort Jeyne Westerling had offered her son. ""**And you wed her the next day.**""

In the face of dishonouring a young woman and having sexual intercourse with her, Robb chose to put this woman before the vows he made to the Freys in marrying one of Walder Frey's granddaughters. 

As readers, we are repeatedly told that Robb is very much like Ned Stark;

>""It would have been kinder to leave her with a bastard in her belly,"" said Tyrion bluntly. The Westerlings stood to lose everything here; their lands, their castle, their very lives. A Lannister always pays his debts.
""Jeyne Westerling is her mother's daughter,"" said Lord Tywin, ""and **Robb Stark is his father's son.**""

If Robb is meant to be like his father in putting a dishonoured girl (Jeyne Westerling) before marital vows (the Freys), then by that logic Ned would also put a dishonoured girl (Ashara Dayne) before martial vows (Catelyn Tully). 

Indeed, if Ned had truly 'dishonoured' Ashara as some like Barristan Selmy may believe, it makes even weaker sense for the Daynes to revere him in such high regard that they're willing to tell their children stories about how much Ned cared about Ashara and even name children like Edric the same short name that Eddard had in Ned.

>""Tell me.""
He looked at her uncomfortably. ""**My aunt Allyria** says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at Harrenhal""î""
""That's not so. He loved my lady mother.""

If Ned Stark had truly slept with Ashara Dayne, left her with child and then abandoned her to marry Catelyn, killed her brother at the Tower of Joy and then watched her commit suicide, it is very doubtful that Ashara's family would hold Ned in such high esteem to tell positive stories about him or name their children after him. Further, if Ned had slept with Ashara Dayne, it is likely that he would've married her the next day just as Robb had married Jeyne Westerling the next day after sleeping with her, especially given that Brandon Stark was still alive at this point and happily betrothed to Catelyn Tully, making Ned free to marry whoever he liked.

**TLDR:** Both Ned and Robb are believed to have at some point been in the same predicament of having dishonoured a young lady and having to choose whether they put the dishonoured lady first or previously arranged martial vows first instead. Ned is believed to have dishonoured Ashara Dayne at the Tourney of Harrenhal and chose his previously arranged marital vows to the Tullies before her honour, whilst Robb instead dishonoured Jeyne Westerling and chose her honour before his previously arranged marital vows to the Freys. Given how Ned and Robb are incredibly similar and this is an image GRRM repeatedly tries to instill in readers as well as the honourable and noble image GRRM builds in Ned Stark as a character, it is very likely that Ned was not the Stark who had sexual intercourse with Ashara at the Tourney of Harrenhal.

"I might be in a minority on this one but would anyone else have preferred Volume 2 to be released before Volume 1? Obviously we all would have preferred Winds of Winter, but i just feel like we already know a fair bit about pre-Dragonbane monarchs from GRRM's other stories in 'Dangerous women' and 'Rogue Prince' and even World of Ice and Fire has far detail on the reigns of the pre-Dragonbane monarchs than Post-Dance monarchs.

I mean we still know relatively speaking almost nothing about the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Maekar, and Aegon the Unlikely. As for the Blackfyre rebellions, i feel like are information on them is still pretty scant as we dont actually know a huge amount about Bittersteel. And of course, Summerhall. We know next to nothing about it and its a seemingly important piece of recent ASOIAF history. I mean i still liked Fire and Blood, but i would preferred a bit more info on the later monarchs.

*TL;DR would you guys have preferred Volume 2 of Fire and Blood before Volume 1?*",SPOILER
"On a reread of *A Storm of Swords*, I was reading the scene where Sansa escapes Joffrey's wedding when something Littlefinger said jumped out at me:

> '""It [our meetings] had to be the godswood. No other place in the Red Keep is safe from the eunuch's little birds . . . or little rats, as I call them. There are trees in the godswood instead of walls. Sky above instead of ceiling. Roots and dirt and rock in place of floor. The rats have no place to scurry. Rats need to hide, lest men skewer them with swords.""ù

The irony of this statement is awesome. Littlefinger thinks he is untouchable by using a secret meeting location to plan Sansa's escape from King's Landing. But he has no idea how much Bran is capable of seeing. Littlefinger is himself a rat, with ""no place to scurry"" in the end. While what happens in the Godswood does not incriminate Littlefinger, the irony of him using the Godswood, a location within the sight of Bran, is beautiful. It's unknown how GRRM will handle Littlefinger's demise (if any). But with the TV show in mind, it portrays how Bran's omnipresence will probably be what does Littlefinger in. ",SPOILER
"In Fire & Blood, we see Princess Aerea Targaryen leaves Dragonstone riding Balerion, and ends up in the ruins of Old Valyria. Septon Barth's account of this choice of destination for Aerea and Balerion would have reminded a lot of people about Dany's riding Drogon. 

* Both girls are flying a dragon for the first time,

* They have not yet learned to bind the dragon to their will, not enough to get them to go where the rider wants them to go. 

* In both cases the dragons flew to their birthplaces. Balerion to Valyria and Drogon to the Dothraki Sea. 

Now to the relevant bit:

Septon Barth wrote about this in his *True Telling*. It's probable that he noted this tendency of dragons to return to their birthplaces in his other dragon-related works (not necessarily mentioning Aerea). And there is an ardent fan of Barth's writings present in Meereen: Tyrion. If the Battle of Meereen concludes in favor of Team Targaryen, it's likely to happen before Dany returns. And if Tyrion was in charge of the city like in the show, or at least he got a say in some of the political matters, he will do well to remember the Aerea incident and send men not searching randomly, but specifically to the Dothraki Sea. Vaes Dothrak would be a good place to start, being the only Dothraki city. This is essentially the same ending as the show, but the way Daario and Jorah just running across a ring in the desert and finding Dany from there is highly unlikely to happen in the books. And Dany could do with some backup, when dealing with the Dothraki. ",SPOILER

"__TL DR:__ I once made a case for Jon returning as [Jon the Implacable](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/48lais/spoilers_everything_jon_the_implacable/). Now, I will expand  on Jon Ice Eyes.


> __A Feast for Crows - Samwell I__

> '""Jon, I cannot disobey my _father_.""ù

> **_Jon_, he'd said, but Jon was gone. It was Lord Snow who faced him now, grey eyes as hard as ice.** '""You have no father,""ù said Lord Snow. '""Only brothers. Only us. Your life belongs to the Night's Watch, so go and stuff your smallclothes into a sack, along with anything else you care to take to Oldtown. You leave an hour before sunrise.""ù

This change from Jon to Lord Snow is so important that GRRM felt the need to repeat the same scene in Jon's POV and explain what it was about.

> __A Dance with Dragons - Jon II__

> '""Jon, I cannot disobey my _father_.""ù

> **_Kill the boy_, Jon thought. _The boy in you, and the one in him. Kill the both of them, you bloody bastard_.** '""You have no father. Only brothers. Only us. Your life belongs to the Night's Watch, so go and stuff your smallclothes into a sack, along with anything else you care to take to Oldtown. You leave an hour before sunrise.""ù 

> ...

> '""Allow me to give my lord one last piece of counsel,""ù the old man had said, '""the same counsel that I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time. He was three-and-thirty when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron Throne. A man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy. Egg had an innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. _Kill the boy within you_, I told him the day I took ship for the Wall. **_It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let the man be born_.**""ù The old man felt Jon's face. '""You are half the age that Egg was, and your own burden is a crueler one, I fear. You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. __Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born__.""ù

In accordance with Aemon's advice, Jon donned his '""lord face.""ù Not surprisingly, it was Lord Stark's face because Jon learned everything from the Ned just like Robb.

> **A Game of Thrones - Bran I**

> Bran's father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. __He had taken off Father's face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.__

> ""¶

> **A Storm of Swords - Jaime VI**

> He remembered Eddard Stark, riding the length of Aerys's throne room wrapped in silence. Only his eyes had spoken; __a lord's eyes, cold and grey and full of judgment__.

> ""¶

> **A Game of Thrones - Bran IV**

> Robb was seated in Father's high seat, wearing ringmail and boiled leather and __the stern face of Robb the Lord__.

The Stark history is full of such Kings and Lords because they had to be in order to survive through such harsh times.

> **A Game of Thrones - Bran VII**

> ""They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years,"" Maester Luwin said, lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces. Some were hairy and bearded, shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by their feet. Others were shaved clean, their features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron longswords across their laps. ""__Hard men for a hard time__. Come.""

> ""¶

> **A Dance with Dragons - Bran III**

> And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and __hard, stern men__ in fur and chain mail.

> ""¶

> **A Dance with Dragons - Davos IV**

> When old King Edrick Stark had grown too feeble to defend his realm, the Wolf's Den was captured by slavers from the Stepstones. They would brand their captives with hot irons and break them to the whip before shipping them off across the sea, and these same black stone walls bore witness.

> '""Then a long cruel winter fell,""ù said Ser Bartimus. '""The White Knife froze hard, and even the firth was icing up. The winds came howling from the north and drove them slavers inside to huddle round their fires, and whilst they warmed themselves the new king come down on them. _Brandon Stark_ this was, Edrick Snowbeard's great-grandson, him that men called __Ice Eyes__. He took the Wolf's Den back, stripped the slavers naked, and gave them to the slaves he'd found chained up in the dungeons. It's said they hung their entrails in the branches of the heart tree, as an offering to the gods. The _old gods_, not these new ones from the south. Your Seven don't know winter, and winter don't know them.""ù

Now we can see that Jon's natural progression is to be this hard and stern winter king like the Starks of old because that is what people in the North need. After the assassination, we will meet Jon Ice Eyes. For this to happen, Jon does not need to die and come back; he does not need to lose a part of himself to Ghost; he does not need any supernatural drive. This is the natural course of his story and it will be his conscious decision to embrace this type of leadership.",SPOILER

One thing that I did not consider before is that Ilyn Payne is poor man's Ned Stark which is why Jaime employed him in his subconscious.

> A Feast for Crows - Jaime III
> 
> Payne seemed as comfortable in his silence as in his rusted ringmail and boiled leather. The clop of his gelding's hooves and the rattle of sword in scabbard whenever he shifted his seat were the only sounds he made. Though his pox-scarred face was grim and __his eyes as cold as ice on a winter lake__, Jaime sensed that he was glad he'd come.

1. Headsman with a great sword.

1. Silent treatment.

1. Cold eyes etc.

Jaime is glad that the Payne is with him. Jaime opens up to Payne and confesses to a lot of things in between their sparring where Ilyn Payne kills him over and over again. As I commented in the other thread, Jaime's confrontation with the moral authority that is Ned Stark is therapeutic and this is why we can see Jaime getting better by spending time with a stand-in Ned Stark. 

> This dark space is Jaime's subconscious where he buries his problems about breaking his oaths (which includes killing Aerys, not saving Rhaegar's children etc.) Even his affair with Cersei is alluded to here by Jaime having an erection when he thinks about Cersei during the dream. These are all long standing issues that Jaime did not deal with by some sort of core self-evaluation. He shits on Ned for judging him with his cold eyes but in fact, Jaime _should_ judge his actions all by himself. Not doing this self-judgment is a character flaw of Jaime. He decided to keep some of his vows and break the others but was his judgment right? Jaime did not answer that question yet.",SPOILER

There's only been like what, 16 dragons at one time? Where'd the rest of the eggs go? It was a BIG deal that Elissa Farman stoke 3 of them. Did Egg accidentally destroy them all at Summerhall?

"I started listening to the Accursed Kings novels, and a quote from The Iron King about Phillip IV's attorney general/torturer [Guillaume de Nogaret] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_de_Nogaret) reminded me a *lot* of Bloodraven:

>Nogaret lived in a world in which everything was ordered by one rule: reasons of state. In his eyes, individuals counted for nothing, not even himself. 

>There is a singular strand running through history, always renewing itself: that of fanatics for the general good, and for the written law. Logical to the point of inhumanity, pitiless towards others as to themselves, these servants of abstract gods and of absolute law accept the roles of executioners because they wish to be the last executioner. They deceive themselves, because once dead, the world no longer obeys them. \

Sounds a lot like *Mystery Knight* era Bloodraven, no? Particularly ""Logical to the point of inhumanity, pitiless towards others as to themselves"". I don't know if it's a direct inspiration (obviously Nogaret is not a magician), but it certainly sounded reminiscent of our favorite one-eyed authoritarian spymaster. ",SPOILER
"I'm trying to draw some connections between Maesters and Magic. Specifically, why do they try to downplay magic in this world when they know its power?

Here are some of the points that stand out.

* There are maesters who study Valyrian magic. In the past, before the Doom, maesters and archmaesters traveled to Valyria in search of answers (answers for what? the seasons, magic, the Long Night, the Bloodstone Emperor, dragons?)
* If Valyrian steel is so rare, where does the Citadel get its supply of Valyrian steel for forging the chain. Do those who want a chain required to provide Valyrian steel in order to get one? I guess you can argue that since so few study it, a large supply need not be necessary, but still, where is that small amount coming from? I know Oldtown is a port so it's likely someone is supplying them, but who? Why can't it be used for say...swords?
* Where does the Citadel get its income from? I remember when Sam had to pay for passage aboard the Cinnamon Wind, he had to forfeit some of the old books he had brought along for the trip. However, the Captain then says not to worry since he will just sell the books to the Citadel for a good price. But where does the Citadel gain the coin to buy these rare books and collections? Donations? Are they funded by the Hightowers? Do the Lords of Westeros pay the Citadel for a maester or are they given one once they establish a castle and lands for themselves?
* In AWOIAF, any instance or mention of the supernatural is dismissed as incredulous and the credibility of the particular maester is questioned. They go after Barth in particular for this.
* They don't believe in godlike powers yet still hold onto godly beliefs. I noticed this when Cressen was talking to himself at the beginning of ACOK. When he's talking to himself, vexed about poisoning Melissandre, he states ""If there are gods..."" Later, he questions divinity itself and its motives by saying ""If the gods are good..."". Point is, he's conflicted. He knows the gods (The 7) don't exist but still tries to convince himself. I think this shows a man who knows more than he should and is vexed about whether he should continue to live in blissful ignorance or miserable truth. We see further that their order doesn't follow godly beliefs when even Luwin posits the theory that ""even gods die, we think. Everything changes.""
* Even their explanation of the Long Night doesn't include the many magical aspects of it. They question the severity of such a season and at times, question if it even happened at all. In AWOIAF, the maester writes ""...if this fell winter did take place, as the tales say..."". The Long Night is a story that is known almost worldwide but THEY are the only ones who believe it wasn't magical beings called the Others who swept Westeros. They believe it to be an exaggerated northern story. In actuality, they believe it was just men, First Men, who lived *even more North than northmen* who began a great migration south that ran them directly into conflict with those living there. The magical aspects are given to portray the Starks as something more than they really are and give credibility to them over this struggle. This explanation has got to be the most asinine explanation the Citadel has ever given. BUT, it goes completely in line with what they do; suppress any notion of magic.
* Maester Luwin admits that he tried his hand at magic but failed. However, he has a chain forged of Valyrian steel. How does one get a chain forged? Does learning about a particular subject earn you your links or do you have to actually show tangible physical proof of your deeds? I would assume so. I mean, how else would you get a chain forged in ravenry unless you actually knew how to send a raven? I think he may have lied to not only to Bran, but to us the reader. I remember Oberyn saying that he studied at the Citadel and had a few links made before he got bored and left but Luwin has a complete chain so that must mean it stands for an accomplishment? Unless there are other ways to forge a chain?
* Given Maester Aemon's vicinity to Maester Luwin, is it possible the 2 may have worked together, with Aemon explaining magic a bit more to Luwin given his blood and family?
* Sam stated Castle Black had scrolls that the Citadel does not. Perhaps they may relate to magic, torn excerpts from the Jade Compendium? Perhaps even Aemon may have brought them there to study further?
* Are those maesters who study magic looked down upon? Aemon studied magic and was stationed at the Wall. Luwin studied magic and was stationed at Winterfell. I mean, they're well fed and safe but it's not exactly Highgarden in terms of weather and life. Even Marwyn is a little standoffish and none of the other archmaesters really like him nor him they.
* Of all the maesters, only Marwyn ever approved of Qyburn and his work. Mirri Maz Duur and Qyburn have both brought people back from the dead (Khal Drogo & Robert Strong, respectively) and we know Marwyn has been to Asshai. Could both of them have learned this from Marwyn? Does Marwyn know how to bring people back from the dead?
* They are 1 of 3 orders that are known to make poisons: The Alchemists of Lys, the Faceless Men of Braavos, and the Maesters of the Citadel.
* Interesting analogy between the 2 orders. The Faceless Men kill their sense of self to allow the assassin to sever any ties with anyone lest it should interfere with carrying out their task. The Maesters give up their last names when they are chained. Both orders hammer in the idea of killing the self so as to do more for the greater (perceived) good.
* They question all of known history since they themselves stated they have no records to go off of. The First Men inscribed runes on stone and every account of history comes from thousands of years later from septons. Septons like to make stuff up (Serwyn of the Mirror Shield who was a Kingsguard...which is impossible as the Kingsguard was only formed after Aegon the Conqueror became King). If they are the smartest minds in Westeros and they have doubts as to what happened, *what, then, REALLY HAPPENED??*
* Did the Long Night really happen long ago like everyone says it did or was it...sooner? In one chapter, Sam tells Jon how he is the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch but after reading everything he can, the farthest that he can trace back is upto 674 Lord Commanders. Did the Long Night happen much sooner than expected? Do the maesters know? Do they know what to look for if/when the Long Night comes again?
* Early Hightowers lived IN the Battle Isle (not sure if this helps but putting it there anyway)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Perhaps, they believe mankind is not and will never be ready to understand magic and therefore, always has the propensity to abuse it. We've had a woman give birth to a literal shadow that murdered a man, a blood ritual where a woman was burned alive, an army of ice that can raise the dead, a man who brought back a condemned man from death...I could go on.

"So I'm about a quarter of the way through Fire & Blood, and it suddenly struck me odd why Aegon didn't continue his conquest north of the Wall. I know part of his conquest was allowing many things to stay as the status quo, and allowing the same autonomy that the once-independent kingdoms previously had. But the Night Watch is an anomaly of sorts. A sort of '""federal""ù program that existed long before a unified kingdom existed. So why would he have acquiesced and been perfectly ok with leaving his border at an arbitrary meridian, when the land extends for hundreds, if not thousands of miles further north?

Does anyone have any ideas or theories as to why this may be so? Not so much a hint of winter is mentioned in the first 50 years of Targaryen rule (at least in F&B). So why not go up there and expand your border?",SPOILER

* The purpose of this thread is not to dive into the nerdiest details of the writing process of entire ASOIAF. For the discussion at hand, below explanation of /u/werthead covers everything we need to know.

> Yes. George spent the period May 2000-September 2001 writing the ""Five Year Gap"" version of ADWD. In September 2001 he gave up on that because he kept getting bogged down in exposition and flashbacks and decided to start again picking up immediately after ASoS with a new book, A Feast for Crows.

> From September 2001 to May 2005 he wrote FEAST as one book with all of the characters in it, but whilst he made great progress on characters like Arya, Cersei, Jaime, Brienne etc he made much slower progress on Jon, Daenerys etc. In May 2005 he had 1,600+ manuscript pages (too much for a single book) and it was very lopsided, with some character arcs completed and some barely started. His colleague Daniel Abraham pointed out that the completed or nearly-completed story arcs were all in the south of Westeros and the incomplete ones were in the North or in Essos, and the book could be split accordingly. 1,100 pages were pulled to become FEAST as we know it and 500-600 were left for ADWD.

> For the last week or so I have been back at the Wall with Jon Snow and the men of the Night's Watch. Jon, I think, will be one of the main beneficiaries of my splitting A FEAST FOR CROWS in two. I will have more room to deal with Jon and Stannis and the wildlings and the rest, which will allow me to flesh out their storylines more and bring them to a better resolution... but it's more than that. Although I had ""completed"" something on the order of __five Jon chapters__ before deciding to divide the book, I was never really happy with them, and rereading them now has reinforced my feelings. They need to be much stronger, and I believe I see how to do that now.

> I passed A CLASH OF KINGS last year, and still had plenty more to write. By January, I had more than 1300 pages, and still had storylines unfinished. About three weeks ago I hit 1527 pages of final draft, surpassing A STORM OF SWORDS... but I also had another hundred or so pages of roughs and incomplete chapters, as well as other chapters sketched out but entirely unwritten. That was when I realized that the light I'd seen at the end of the tunnel was actually the headlight of an onrushing locomotive.

> ""¶

> Meanwhile, all the characters and stories removed from FEAST are moving right into A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, which will focus on events in the east and north. All the chapters I have not yet finished and/or begun are moving into DANCE. I think this is very good, if truth be told, since it will give me the room to complete those arcs as I had originally intended, rather than trying to tie them up quickly in a chapter or two so I could deliver the massively late Big FEAST.

> With Feast for Crows, when I did do the split, I hadn't written a word about Bran in that book yet. But I had the Daenerys stuff almost -- pretty far along. I had Tyrion across the Narrow Sea and down the river as far as Volantis, I think, and I was gonna break him there in Volantis and continue on to the next book. But there were other people that I'd hardly started. I had to do a lot of work at the Wall. But I had all the King's Landing stuff pretty much as you'd seen it. The Cersei stuff, the Jaime stuff, all of that.

[Interview](https://ew.com/article/2011/07/21/dance-with-dragons-shocking-twist-g/) with ew

> July 21, 2011

> __How long have you intended for that incident [Jon's assassination] to happen?__

> For many years. Some of the stuff about Melisandre warning Jon of '""daggers in the dark""ù was written 10 years ago.

> ""¶

> __I also wasn't sure whether Ramsay was telling the truth in his letter when he said the battle had already been fought and won, whether we were supposed to take that as gospel.__

> My readers should know better than to take anything as gospel, unless they see it for themselves, and even then I do sometimes use '""unreliable narrator.""ù No. They should not take that as the truth.

* Considering above interviews and SSMs together, where did the 5 leftover Jon chapters end? Obviously, these were not the first 5 Jon chapters of the published version of DANCE. There are some early readings of these Jon chapters from 2003 and it appears that the first of these 5 leftover Jon chapters became Jon I and Jon II; and the second leftover chapter became Jon III and Jon IV in the published DANCE. Clearly GRRM expanded these chapters as he intended. I think it is likely that an assassination was included in the original 5 chapter arc of Jon meant for the unsplit FEAST. I agree with /u/feldman10 that '""*GRRM originally intended Jon's downfall to play out in a more simplistic way, like it did on the show ""î that is, he let in the wildlings, and then his men killed him*.""ù

* But there is one thing that needs to be wedded to this scheme. In the above interview with ew, GRRM pointed that the Pink Letter is not necessarily true about the outcome of the Battle on Ice.

> That we will get some hints of what is going on in the North and East but we wouldn't know what is true and what not. We may learn that Stannis is killed for example but that could easily be a red herring.

* GRRM dropped a very big hint about Stannis back when he split the FEAST and DANCE. Within the 5 leftover Jon chapters, it appears that the death of Stannis was again going to be heard, with or without a Pink Letter. But again, this was not meant to be taken as gospel, which means the true fate of Stannis was still not meant to be revealed yet.

> '""It may be that we shall lose this battle,""ù the king said grimly. '""In Braavos you may hear that I am dead. It may even be true. You shall find my sellswords nonetheless.""ù

* The sample Theon chapter from the WINDS still seems to be on this track. This can only mean Stannis will fake his death after the Battle on Ice. But what will he do next and where will he go?

> '""You could bring the north to me. __Your father's bannermen would rally to the son of Eddard Stark__. Even Lord Too-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse. White Harbor would give me a ready source of supply and __a secure base to which I could retreat at need__.""ù

* Now imagine that the Freys are annihilated when the Manderlys attack them in the rear and then the Manderly commander gives Stannis a letter claiming that his Hand is on a mission to bring Rickon Stark to White Harbor. The story basically writes itself.

"Qyburn!

""Wait, what?"" you ask in this hypothetical because that's the reaction I need you to have. ""How does that fit the Valanquarr prophecy?"" 

Well it doesn't, and that's the point.

Let's look at some other people posited to kill Cersei:

* Brienne

* Jaime

* Margery

* Tyrion

* Arya

* Sansa

* Tommen

* Myrcella 

And plenty more. Notice anything about that list? I'd hope not because it's eclectic and random as fuck, and it's no wonder because the prophecy is so vague that pretty much anyone could be twisted to fit with it. As long as they are in some way a younger sibling, they could potentially be Cersei's Valonqar. It's less specific than most prophecies in ASOIAF and most prophecies are already pretty ill-defined, subject to interpretation. 

You might then call it foreshadowing, but what happens if Cersei is killed by someone who could be considered a Valonqar? She is vindicated in her beliefs and actions. Most her life she has lived in fear of the prophecy and based her decisions around it, and only more so when it seems to be coming true as Joffery dies after she has had three kids. If she is killed by a Valonqar she may die thinking ""this was unavoidable, this was fate and nothing I could have done would have subverted this."" It would provide a measure of justification, or at least personal absolution, to be killed by what she has feared her whole life.

Here I posit Qyburn will kill Cersei precisely because it completely contradicts the valonqar prophecy and thus robs Cersei of such vindication. She dies knowing that everything she has done to escape prophecy was meaningless because the prophecy itself was meaningless. She would die knowing her actions to escape death only drove her straight into it, and that she could have been a different person and suffered a different fate. 

So, from this argument, Qyburn himself doing the deed doesn't matter so much as someone who can not, without a massive stretch, be declared a valonqar being the one to kill Cersei. But in addition: Qyburn has no loyalty to Cersei, merely a desire to be his creepy sociopathic surgeon self in peace, and Qyburn knows all of Cersei's worst crimes. Qyburn would have no reason not to betray Cersei if doing so would interfere with his life less than remaining loyal to her, and betraying her would allow him to direct attention away from his own crimes i.e. revealing what he's done to the Mountain is big enough that leaving out his treatment of the Blue Bard and... unfortunate Cersei victim #12, would not be questioned too closely. 

Also there's the ""poetry"" of Cersei who have so many people to Qyburn ending up in his dungeon herself. It's the kind of justice porn that goes so far that you cannot help but feel bad for the victim ala Theonn. It's such a horrific fate that we the readers cannot even find pleasure in such a horrible character as Cersei's death, which is something that George pulls a few times in regards to his assholes, like Viserys.

Well, it's a idle thought. This post is more to inspire thinking of the end of Cersei's arc beyond the Valonqar prophecy which inspires most discussion on the topic. I'm sure I'm not the first person to suggest ""fuck prophecy,"" but I feel many on this sub should think more about how George presents prophecy and death rather than accepting the inevitability of prophecy in determining a poetic death for Cersei.

"I know about the Blackfyre Theory.

If you believe the full extent of it, then you not only believe that Young Griff is a Blackfyre pretender, but that Varys is himself a Blackfyre.

But lets say most of the theory is correct (for fAegon), while not the case for Varys....

How do you bridge the gap? Why would he support some Essosi kid that Illyrio has a fondness for? Is there any other ***personal*** reason he would want to do so, outside of the obvious obtainment of wealth?

Or is he just another version of Littlefnger, seeking power not through himself, but his the propping up of another ruler?",SPOILER
"This aspect of the Tower of Joy Story never made any sense to me and I never saw it discussed. After he did not care about the realm and the war for a year, while getting Lyanna pregnant, he suddenly decides to join the battle and leave his pregnant woman behind, only to get killed.

Why would he do that? If he worried about Robert winning the war, he had three highly skilled kingsguard at the tower, that he could have ordered to the Trident in his stead. They were better suited to fight in the battle and less suited to keep Lyanna company.

If he send Arthur Dayne instead, he would probably have killed Robert in single combat. House Targaeryen would still hold the Iron Throne.

It makes no sense to me. First he risks everything to get a third child, then he abandons the expectant mother and her child before it is born, although he had better men for the job.

Do you have a good explanation, maybe?",SPOILER
"One of the issues with waiting this long for the series to conclude is that people has over analyzed and theorized every letter of GRRM's entire work entirely to death.  
  
The unfortunate result of this imo, is that it has become almost impossible for the endgame of his work to have a plot twist noone saw coming. From the NK=Bran to time traveling fetuses, I feel like any and all possible outcomes has been imagined and discussed.  
  
The result of all this: No endgame will come as unexpected. No plot twist will be met with a unison ""I didn't see THAT coming!"". GRRM said already in an interview that fans has guessed correct storylines along the way and maybe this is what GRRM finds wearing him down so much. People's expectations are so high and maybe the ending is something many, many has predicted and he is like ""Fuck me..."".

"One of my favorite aspects of Sansa POVs is that she is generally clueless about what is happening around her. I'm not disparaging her for this, since she is only 11-14. But it does mean that you have to look into the subtext of her chapters to understand what's really going on, and because of this many readers miss key insights into events -- before, during and after the present action

A case in point is Sansa and Joffrey's date on the Trident. To Sansa, it was nothing more than a wonderful day with her beloved prince that was spoiled by her little sister. But was it really? Let's take a closer look.

First, let's look at the previous chapter when Ned and Robert go off riding:

>""No, no, no,"" Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. ""The camp is full of ears. Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours."" Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw.

So this is Ned and Robert, two of the fiercest warriors in the realm, the men who overthrew the Blood of the Dragon and ended a 300-year dynasty, and when they go out riding, fully armed and armored themselves, they are accompanied by two KG and a dozen guardsmen.

Then we have Ned's orders to both Sansa and Arya:

>""You're not supposed to leave the column,"" Sansa reminded her. ""Father said so.""

Arya, of course, does just that, routinely, but she looks like a commoner in her wearing dirty old riding leathers while Sansa has ""her nicest blue silks.""

Then we get to the scene where Sansa is frightened by Ser Illyn and she completely misses the fact that she has just insulted herself when she says that the queen has chosen her justice well because he is frightening to the wicked. But that's not all that happens here.

More significant is what comes next:

First, Sansa falls down in tears because the knights have drawn their swords on Lady and the Hound is busting her chops. Joffrey says ""And you, dog, away with you, you're scaring my lady."" Sandor shrugs and backs into the crowd.

Then, Cersei calls off their afternoon together because ""...the good councilors and I must speak together until the king returns with your father."" Then she suggests Joffrey entertain Sansa, and they decide to go off riding together, all alone.

First of all, Robert and Ned are out hunting aurochs. They will be gone all day. What could Cersei possibly need to discuss with Selmy, Renly and Ser Illyn (the tongueless) for the entire day?

Secondly, Sandor is Joffrey's sworn shield. That means he has made a solemn promise to Robert and Cersei that he will protect Joffrey at all times and give his life for his prince if need be. Joffrey may have the authority to tell him to back off, but not to take the whole day off while he and Sansa go galivanting into completely unfamiliar territory. The fact that the Hound suffered no disciplinary action for going AWOL even after Joffrey was attacked by a dire wolf is pretty clear evidence that he was not supposed to be there.

But why? Why would anyone, even Cersei, willingly risk the life of the crown prince and the daughter of the hand in this way? Their clothes alone would be worth a small fortune to any smallfolk, let alone Sansa's jewels and Joffrey's fine castle-forged steel with gold pommel. If not even Ned and Robert can leave the column without a tail of armored knights, how can this possibly be OK for two royal teenagers?

The answer, of course, is in the subtext. 

We already know that Cersei is suspicious of Ned, so she cannot be too pleased with this betrothal. So what better way to undo this than to put Sansa in a compromising position in front of the court so that everyone will think she is not a fit consort for the prince and future king.

How to do this? Well, getting them alone is step one. And by this, I mean alone as far as anyone knows. A few carefully chosen scouts could certainly make sure there are no brigands or rowdys about, which again, would have gone completely unnoticed by Sansa.

The next step is to create circumstantial evidence to question Sansa's morals. During the ride, note that Joffrey has a blood bay courser, a horse bred for speed, and he rode it with ""wild abandon."" Sansa, meanwhile, is hard-pressed to keep up. Sansa is also not a big fan or horses, which is something that Cersei could easily have learned back in Winterfell. And what happens to lady parts when they are suddenly subjected to vigorous riding?

Then they stop at the inn where ""Sansa drank more wine than she ever drank before.""

So now imagine what would have happened if they did not run into Arya and Mycah and instead went back to the column sweaty, disheveled and reeking of wine, only to have Cersei playing the nervous mother wondering where her royal son and the hand's daughter have been all afternoon without guards or chaperones. Then imagine the shock when Cersei implies that they could have been off doing the nasty, but surely my royal son would never compromise his morals this way, and Joffrey says ""Well ... "" Later, of course, he spins a tale about how he didn't want to go swimming but Sansa insisted and when they were naked in the water ""she approached me wantonly and said 'let me show you what I do sometimes with my brother and half-brother...'""

So sure, it's a he said/she said thing. But who will sit in judgement of all this? King Robert, who is now faced with a choice of either declaring Sansa to be a wanton trollop or saying that his own son and heir is a liar, and perhaps a raper as well.

The political ramifications of the latter are quite severe, so in the end it is likely that Sansa's rep is forever tarnished, and even a physical exam, while not proving her guilt, could certainly not be used to proclaim her innocence. Meanwhile, Joffrey would get a ""bad boy"" but in the end this is a society in which lustful women are always tempting men away from their inherent saintliness. So if anything, Joffrey comes out of this with his rep enhanced as the prince who is so handsome and magnetic that even highborn maids are overcome with desire in his mere presence.

And the big winner, of course, is Cersei, who not only rids herself of a betrothal she didn't want, but quite possibly the Hand she fears more than anyone.

There is actually more to this little tale than I have revealed, so I'll end it here. In a future post, I'll explain why Joffrey was planning to take Cersei's plot to the next level by killing Sansa outright.

"From *Fire & Blood*:

> The thirteenth day of the fourth moon of 56 AC *dawned cold and grey, with a blustery wind blowing* from the east.

> [...]

> Elsewhere in the Red Keep, Queen Alysanne spent the morning with her children; Princess Daenerys had finally warmed to her brother, Aemon, though she still wanted a little sister. 

> [...]

> All of them would long remember what they were doing when **they heard the blast of a horn** ringing through the morning air. *""The sound of it ran down my spine like a cold knife,"" the queen would say later, ""though I could not have said why.""* In a lonely watchtower overlooking the waters of Blackwater Bay, a guard had glimpsed dark wings in the distance and sounded the alarum. **He sounded the horn again** as the wings grew larger, **and a third time** when he saw the dragon plain, black against the clouds. 

> Balerion had returned to King's Landing. (Jaehaerys and Alysanne""îTheir Triumphs and Tragedies)

I thought it was a neat reversal to have three horn blasts signal the coming of a dragon, rather than the Others. The cold, windy weather helps reinforce this connection, as does Alysanne (who would later visit the Night's Watch at the Wall) experiencing a chilly reaction to the sound. And I doubt it's a coincidence that two young Targaryen princelings, Daenerys and Aemon, are also among those to hear the ominous horn, given Dany and Jon's presumed importance in the war for the dawn (Jon possibly being a Targaryen named Aemon or Aegon). If there is some foreshadowing here, besides the Horn of Winter bringing down the Wall, it could be that the Others have or will obtain a dragon of their own -- perhaps an ice dragon, or one of Dany's dragons after they kill and resurrect it -- and that such a dragon might even descend upon King's Landing.

(Of course, in the show, Aegon is the name of choice for Jon, and the White Walkers already got a dragon of their own, which could very well fly to King's Landing.)

Also, this happened on the ""thirteenth day of the fourth moon."" Substitute month for moon, translate it to our calendar, and you get April 13, the day before the Season 8 premiere! Even more foreshadowing! /s",SPOILER

"This post is about the present whereabouts of Chella of the Black Ears, one of Tyrion's original mountain clan captains. I post it as a quick case study in how deeply GRRM has embedded ASOIAF with a kind of textual ""rhyming"" appropriate for a story that is, after all, a *""Song""*.

(Note that this post re-works some details I buried *very* deeply in [a *huge* writing about a superficially unrelated topic](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/ser-byron-the-beauty-and-the-beast-sandor-clegane/).)

***
***
***

Chella of the Black Ears is last ""seen"" being denied entry to King's Landing via the River Gate in ASOS Tyrion I:
>""I sent Pod looking for Shagga, but he's had no luck.""

>""The Stone Crows are still in the kingswood. Shagga seems to have taken a fancy to the place. Timett led the Burned Men home, with all the plunder they took from Stannis's camp after the fighting. **Chella turned up with a dozen Black Ears at the River Gate one morning, but your father's red cloaks chased them off while the Kingslanders threw dung and cheered.**""

>Ingrates. The Black Ears died for them.

*So where is she ""now""?*

It's my belief that she is the female Poor Fellow/sparrow guarding Lancel Lannister at Darry in the Riverlands late in AFFC. (Get it? River Gate; Riverlands.) This one:
>""Lord Lancel is asking the Father Above for guidance,"" said **the third sparrow, the beardless one. *A boy*, Jaime had thought, but her voice marked her for a woman, dressed in shapeless rags and a shirt of rusted mail.** ""He is praying for the soul of the High Septon and all the others who have died.""

>""They'll still be dead tomorrow,"" Jaime told her. ""The Father Above has more time than I do. Do you know who I am?""

>""Some lord,"" said the big man with the starry eye.

>""Some cripple,"" said the small one with the big beard.

>**""The Kingslayer,"" said the woman**, ""but we're no kings, just Poor Fellows, and you can't go in unless his lordship says you can."" **She hefted a spiked club**, and the small man raised an axe. (FFC J IV)

Why do I think so? Several things suggest as much.

First, much as Jamie think the sparrow-woman is a ""boy"", so is Chella likened to a ""boy"":
>Chella was a small hard woman, **flat as a boy, and no fool.** (GOT Ty VII)

Second, Chella being ""no fool"" clearly jibes with the sparrow-woman being the only one of Lancel's three guards to grok who Jaime is.

The sparrow-woman ""heft[ing] a *spiked club*"" is perhaps the key clue, because the *only* ""spiked clubs"" we see prior to this in ASOIAF are wielded by Tyrion's clansmen:
>""¶suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn, lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor, faces hidden behind barred half helms. In gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons: longswords and lances and sharpened scythes, **spiked clubs** and daggers and heavy iron mauls. (GOT Ty IV)

This is all suggestive, but for me the real ""proof"" comes from my belief that ASOIAF is truly a ""song"" of sorts, with characters constantly related others via various ""rhyming"" schemes embedded in the verbiage. The best way to explain what I mean by that in general is via example, and the idea that the ""third sparrow,""¶ a woman, *dressed in shapeless rags and a shirt of rusted mail*"" is none other than Chella of the Black Ears is a great case study.

What is Chella infamous for? *Collecting the ears of her enemies,* right?
>Chella daughter of Cheyk rode up as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga, and showed them four ears she had taken. (GOT Ty VIII)
***
>""M'lord Varys complimented Chella on her ears and said she must have killed many men to have such a fine necklace,"" Shae explained. (COK Ty I)
***
>""Braver to leave the man alive, with a chance to cleanse his shame by winning back his ear,"" explained Chella, a small dark woman whose grisly neckware was hung with no less than forty-six dried, wrinkled ears. (ibid.)

Cutting off ears is pretty unforgettable, and it just so happens to be what Ser Bennis of the Brown Shield (Dunk's degenerate ""comrade"" in *The Sworn Sword*) threatens to do to some peasants in *The Sworn Sword*:
>""You lot don't hear so good,"" said Bennis. ""**Do I need to lop me off an ear or two?** Who's first?""

And how does Bennis dress?
>The brown knight looked just as he had when they left; worse, **he smelled the same as well. He wore the same garb every day: brown** breeches, **a shapeless roughspun tunic,** horsehide boots. When armored he donned a loose brown surcoat over **a shirt of rusted mail.** (tSS)

Like a sparrow""î
>Ahead loomed the Great Sept of Baelor, with its magnificent dome and seven shining towers, but between her and the marble steps lay a sullen sea of humanity, **brown and ragged and unwashed. Sparrows, she thought, sniffing, though no sparrows had ever smelled so rank.** (FFC C VI)

""îand, more specifically, pretty much *exactly* like Lancel's sparrow-woman guard, who verbatim wears *""a shirt of rusted mail""*, exactly like Bennis-the-would-be-ear-chopper does. Significantly, this is the *only* other ""shirt of rusted mail"" in the canon, so the characters are uniquely linked by this motif.

Note also the rhyme between the sparrow-woman's ""*shapeless* rags"" and Bennis-the-would-be-ear-chopper's ""*shapeless* roughspun tunic"". To be sure, the sparrow-woman's ""rags"" are almost certainly a ""roughspun tunic"" exactly like Bennis's as well, inasmuch as (a) the other ""sparrows"" of Darry wear ""ragged, filthy *tunics*"", another term for which might be ""rags""""î
>As Jaime trotted across the yard [of Castle Darry], chickens ran out from under Honor's hooves, sheep bleated, and peasants stared at him with sullen eyes. Armed peasants, he did not fail to note. Some had scythes, some staves, some hoes sharpened to cruel points. There were axes in evidence as well, and he spied several bearded men with red, seven-pointed stars sewn onto **ragged, filthy tunics. More bloody sparrows.** Where do they all come from? (FFC J IV)

""î(b) the High Sparrow wears a ""shapeless *tunic* of undyed wool""""î
>In place of the rich robes of his predecessors, he wore **a shapeless tunic of undyed wool** that fell down to his ankles. (DWD C I)

""îand (c) Lancel himself wears a ""plain, *roughspun tunic* of undyed wool that made him look more like a beggar than a lord"". (DWD C I; ibid.)

(An analysis which already takes the texts poetic metatextuality as a given might also note that in *The Sworn Sword*, Egg wears a ""*ragged* brown tunic"" which further underscores the likelihood that (a) his companion Bennis the Brown's ""shapeless""¶ tunic"" is also ""ragged"", and hence could be described as ""rags"", and (b) that the sparrow-woman's ""shapeless rags"" are a ""tunic"".)

Combined with the sparrow-woman and Bennis-the-would-be-ear-chopper being uniquely linked via their ""shirt[s] of rusted mail"", the sparrow-woman clearly being shrewd like Chella, likened to a boy like Chella, and armed with a weapon associated with the clansmen, I think the neat little ""rhyme"" between the sparrow-woman's ""shapeless rags"" (which are almost assuredly a roughspun tunic) and Bennis-the-would-be-ear-chopper's unwashed, ""shapeless roughspun tunic"" (which could easily be called ""ragged"" or ""rags"") leaves little doubt that the sparrow-woman *is* Bennis's fellow ear-chopper, Chella.

But this means that the text is far more than a simple narrative: it is a painstakingly crafted, self-conscious puzzle rife with metatextuality. The language of in-world details like a ""shirt of rusted mail"" or ""shapeless"" garb isn't always happenstance: it's often *contrived* in the service of the ""song"" ASOIAF is ""singing"" beneath its prosaic seeming.

As discussed in the piece from which this post is reworked, Chella isn't the only analogue to Bennis. ASOIAF's ""rhymes"" are rarely about perfect one-to-one parallels. In this case, it's my belief that a great many things about Bennis's ""seeming"" *besides* his ""shapeless roughspun tunic"" and ""shirt of rusted mail"" have a curious poetic resonance with Lother Brune.

Lothor, too, wears shabby, explicitly brown attire. Sansa describes Lothor's clothing like this""î
>**no proper knight** would wear those patched **brown breeches and scuffed boots, nor that cracked and water-stained leather jerkin.** (SOS San VI)

""îwhile Dunk describes Bennis""îwho readers of *The Sworn Sword* know is truly *""no proper knight""*""îlike this:
>[Bennis] wore the same garb every day: **brown breeches**, a shapeless roughspun tunic, **horsehide boots.** When armored he donned a loose **brown surcoat** over a shirt of rusted mail. His swordbelt was a cord of **boiled leather, and his seamed face might have been made of the same thing.**

Thus both wear ""brown breeches"", verbatim. Both explicitly wear boots. Bennis's brown surcoat and ""seamed face"", seemingly of ""boiled leather"" can be read as a poetic reworking of Brune's ""cracked water-stained leather jerkin"": Leather is leather, ""seamed"" is ""cracked""; ""boiled"" implies water a la ""water-stained""; a jerkin is a jacket is a [sur]coat.

Note, too, that Bennis is ""Bennis the Brown"", while the Brunes are from ""*Brown*hollow"" and ""Brune"" is a style of Trappist ale that translates to and is often called Brown. (FFC B VI)

Lothor's *character* isn't prefigured by Bennis's, but Lothor notably walks squarely in Bennis's footsteps once, albeit in a vastly different context. Having threatened to cut off the peasants' ears as Chella might, Bennis ends up cutting an ""old man's cheek"":
>""Your talk don't frighten us,"" said the old man [to Bennis].

>""No?"" **Bennis made his longsword whistle, opening the old man's cheek from ear to jaw.** ""I said, them pear trees die, or you do."" The digger's blood ran red down one side of his face.

>He should not have done that. Dunk had to swallow his rage. Bennis was on his side in this. ""Get away from here,"" he shouted at the diggers. ""Go back to your lady's castle.""

>""Run,"" Ser Bennis urged.

>Three of them let go of their tools and did just that, sprinting through the grass. (tSS)

Lothor Brune gets Marillion off Sansa and fleeing in almost identical fashion, right down to the initial threat and defiance:
>Sansa heard the soft sound of steel on leather. ""Singer,"" a rough voice said, ""best go, if you want to sing again."" The light was dim, but she saw a faint glimmer of a blade.

>The singer saw it too. ""Find your own wench""î"" **The knife flashed, and he cried out. ""You cut me!""**

>""I'll do worse, if you don't go.""

>And quick as that, Marillion was gone. The other remained, looming over Sansa in the darkness. ""Lord Petyr said watch out for you."" It was Lothor Brune's voice, she realized. (SOS San VI)

It's interesting that Bennis is tied to both Lothor and Chella, who are themselves linked by wordplay: besides alluding to ""brown"" as in Bennis, ""Brune"" is a homophone for ""bruin"", meaning ""bear"", and House Brune's sigil is a bear claw. ([Bruin the Bear](http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/european/reynardbruin.html), by the way, is a character in the medieval Reynard the Fox stories I believe ASOIAF is frequently in dialogue with.) Lothor is also a protective bear-figure. (See sweetsunray's blog for a *ton* of great stuff about bear symbolism in ASOIAF.)

Dressed all in brown, Lothor Brune is thus a figurative ""brown bear"", whereas Chella is a member of the Black Ears who is likewise a protective figure. The word play is right there:
>Brown: black :: bear : ear.

Notice that both Chella and Lothor are intimately related to events in the Vale. Indeed, I have argued they are part of a much larger rhyming scheme between the Dunk & Egg Tales""îespecially *The Mystery Knight*""îand ASOIAF's Vale plot. You can read about that in detail [here](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2018/12/15/littlefingers-third-knight-ser-byron-is-tyrek-lannister-a-k-a-where-is-tyrek-part-2/) and [here](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/ser-byron-the-beauty-and-the-beast-sandor-clegane/) if you're interested. Here, my point is simply that even something as seemingly obscure as the Bennis/sparrow-woman ""rhyme"" is part of something ""bigger""/""deeper"" than itself.

In closing, did you notice that Chella being the sparrow-woman creates a spiffy little joke? She's a ""Poor Fellow"" now, right? Which is neatly ironic, as it is future-*Poor Fellow* Chella who answers Varys's famous riddle about who would survive a stand-off in which ""a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold"" all try to enjoin a sellsword to kill the other two men by saying:
>""The rich man lives. Doesn't he?"" (COK Ty I)

(Note that this joke is every bit as metatextual as secret-Chella sharing a rusted mail shirt with her fellow ear-chopper Bennis.)

Thanks for reading.

* Was he met with any racism being a Wildling? It seems as though he was very proud of his Wildling heritage but it doesn't say how the other members of the Night's Watch reacted to this.

"Traitor to his family?

After reading F&B I think it's all but confirmed that there is a Hightower/Citadel/Faith conspiracy to at the very least get rid of Dragons. I personally believe this includes preventing Targaryens from being able to hatch and ride dragons, but I have a few questions that I'm hoping people smarter than myself can help me with.

1. Is Vaegon a traitor? The Grand Maester disqualifies Vaegon from ever being a maester as soon as he's asked by Jahaerys, which is a clear indicator that the Citadel doesn't want a Targ anywhere near their inner circle. Well in his time as an archmaester, has he been flipped? He suggests the idea of the Great Council which despite the outcome, leads to a succession crisis down the line. Was this the Citadel's plan all along?
2. Do any Targs possess the knowledge about what factors in to hatching dragons? Obviously it's genetic, but I find it hard to believe that no Targ ever figured out the key to their own power and dominion, least of all Vaegon. Was he the key to the Citadel developing their plans for the Dance?
3. It seems like all the steps the Citadel takes to manipulate the Targ/Dragon line are successful, but are they even more successful than we know? Did they not only eliminate dragons, but the Targs that knew about Dragons? Both of Vaegon's older brother's deaths practically scream assassination. Who better to select the correct targets?

I honestly don't even want to be right about this, but I think the Targaryens were betrayed by their own blood. Thoughts?",SPOILER
"I understand that the eastern side of the north would have more port towns, as it is pointing in the direction of the rest of the world.  That's where White Harbor is, that's where Eastwatch and Hardome are based.  They interact with not only Westeros but the eastern cities as well.  
  
But...  
  
The North is vast, it's unfeasible for all the inter-kingdom trade to either flow through the east coast or the King's Road, especially if the Neck is something that can be choked up as we have seen in almost every major war.  In addition, the west coast of Westeros has a history of worrying about the Iron Islanders, which results in having defensible coastal cities like Seagard be a necessity.   To boot, you've got island states like Bear Island whose nearest trading port is what, Lannisport?  Where's the lord that protects the fishermen of the Stony Shore or Seadragon Point?  Flint's Finger can't be that useful, it was owned by one of the Driftwood Kings from the Iron Islands for a while.  
  
Or am I overthinking it, and are the Northmen of the west just more self sufficient?",SPOILER

She went from being sexually assaulted to falling in love with an ""ugly"" dwarf on the surface it is suspect. We barely know about her outside of Tyrion's rose tinted nostalgic view of her. 

Thoughts?",SPOILER
"After the conquest of Westeros by Aegon I there was a great opportunity for the fledgling dynasty to solidify its rule of the 7 kingdoms that was lost, Aegon should have done to a lesser extent what William I of England did to the Saxon nobility after his own conquest, he should've centralised his rule and make the Iron Throne much more powerful, I understand why he didn't do it since he thought his descendants will always have dragons to enforce their rule, well that didn't work but even if it did, it certainly doesn't hurt to further secure his rule and make it stronger especially when one has the muscle (dragons) to make that possible. 

If I were Aegon I will directly administer both the Reach and Westerlands and incorporate them into the Crown lands. I will depose and exile the Lannisters and not appoint anyone as the Lord paramount of the Reach after the Gardener line ended, after centuries of rule these regions will eventually come to accept Targaryen rule and all mumors of Lannisters or Gardener rule will be distant memory. 

With these 2 powerful kingdoms plus the current Crownlands strongly anchored under Targaryen rule surely no pretender or rebel could  hope to unseat the Targaryens, this means that Robert's rebellion will never have happened and the Targaryens will still continue to rule. Aegon V would also have had far more success in implementing his reforms. 

Instead Aegon developed a huge problem for his dynasty in allowing the former Kings to retain all their honours, seats, lands and incomes which means that they still retained large armies and strong castles, they also still retained a large amount of influence. 

After the dragons died about 150 years into the conquest the opportunity was lost seemingly forever since the Iron Throne then couldn't suddenly embark on a mission to conquer the Reach and the Westerlands and incorporate them under direct IT rule, that will be suicidal and lead to a giant civil war which the Targaryens will likely lose. 

The best chance the Targaryens have to remedy this fatal mistake is for Daenerys to do what I just proposed and unlike Aegon she has the foresight of knowing that dragons may not last forever. 

TLDR: Aegon I should've centralised his rule by taking direct control of more kingdoms and taking over larger parts of the land and populace to be direct Targaryen subjects instead of relying on other Lords to muster those lands in support of the IT.",SPOILER

"This post originated as a way to gather my thoughts and part of this is me just speculating about events in TWOW and ADOS. However, Dany's final set of visions in the House of the Undying have always been of great interest to me and on a re-read of the series (plus some fan speculation I've read on here), I think I've found some possible answers. With a total of nine visions, there are three groups of three that are tied together by a ""theme"" of sorts (daughter of death / slayer of lies / bride of fire). Relating these visions together can give more insight on what could happen next in the series, or maybe I'm just crazy...

&#x200B;

**Mother of Dragons / Daughter of Death**

Here we see how Dany is associated with death, precisely the way that death has consumed a significant part of her family:

>'""Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth.""ù 

This being how her brother Viserys was killed by Khal Drogo.

>'""A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him.""ù 

In reference to how her son Rhaego was killed *in utero* by Mirri Maz Duur.

>'""Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name.""ù 

A vision of how her brother Rhaegar was killed by Robert Baratheon.

&#x200B;

**Mother of Dragons / Slayer of Lies**

Here we see those who are '""pretenders""ù and will (unsuccessfully) attempt to usurp her rightful place as queen / prophesied princess / mother of dragons:

>'""Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow.""ù 

If we can accept the fact that Dany is the real prince that was promised / Azor Ahai reborn, that makes Stannis (ironically enough) a pretender and usurper.

>'""A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd.""ù 

This would relate to how Young Griff is a dragon (perhaps a Blackfyre pretender?) being propped up by Varys as a way to rule benevolently over the common people of Westeros.

(*There's a whole lot of speculation / tinfoil following this, just warning you...*)

>'""From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire.""ù 

This requires a lot of speculation. Melisandre gives the rather ominous prophecy that the '""first blow""ù of the Great Other will come at '""crumbling towers by the sea.""ù She even sees skulls rising from water around a tower with a ""beast"" flying overhead, connecting these two visions. While she (and the showrunners) interpret this as Eastwatch-by-the-sea, I propose an alternative: Pyke. Euron will try to recreate Dany's '""waking dragons from stone""ù (probably when the Victarion-blowing-dragonbinder plan fails) by using some form of magic which will backfire and create something""¶ awful / weird / eldritch. However, Dany will then show the world that she was the one who really woke dragons from stone, not whatever imitation Euron creates.

&#x200B;

**Mother of Dragons / Bride of Fire**

Rather simply, I propose that this is in reference to men that Dany will marry / have... relations with. (Yes, I realize this requires us to not count her marriage to Hizdahr, though I also suggest that this is only about marriages that involve her Targaryen lineage.)

>'""Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars.""ù 

This very directly mirrors Dany and Drogo's consummation of marriage from AGOT. This would involve her Targaryen lineage since it's her marriage to Drogo that '""brings out the dragon""ù in Dany.

>'""A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly.""ù 

This could be a vision of a future marriage / relationship with Young Griff / Aegon. While many speculate this is in reference to Jon Connington (which it is), I would interpret it as JonCon being the one who links her to Young Griff in the same way her silver links her to Drogo in the previous vision. Not only was JonCon taking Young Griff to Meereen to marry her, but Dany might agree to a marriage later (in Westeros) to prevent/stop another Dance of Dragons.

>'""A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.""ù 

In reference to a future marriage / relationship with Jon Snow. This one is fairly obvious as these two are destined to meet up and the show has confirmed(?) a future relationship between the two. As with the previous two visions, the Wall that she sees is what will link her to Jon, just as JonCon would be her link to Young Griff and her silver would be her link to Khal Drogo. Perhaps when Dany learns about the Others and heads north she'll meet Jon and start a relationship from there (either in secret or openly if Young Griff is dead by then). 

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm the last person on the planet to come to these realizations or maybe I've struck gold here. Let me know if you agree / disagree and how you think these visions relate to each other.",SPOILER
"Why did Maegor I name Aerea as his heir? 

He had to disinherit Jaehaerys I to do so, and Maegor died trying to put down a popular rebellion started by Jaehaerys, I'm not sure he would have rebelled if he was still the heir. I first thought Maegor might have been motivated to spite his dead brother Aenys, Jaehaerys' father, for banishing him, but Aerea was descended from Aenys too, and as a child, Aerea was ""a shy, timid girl, much given to tears, bed-wetting, and fears... frightened of horses, dogs, boys with loud voices, men with beards, and dancing, and terrified of dragons,"" Jaehaerys was showing no such red flags at the time, and there was plenty of evidence at the time that Maegor might not produce an heir. So it might have been to spite Jaehaerys himself for escaping from his imprisonment on Dragonstone after Visenya's death, but then, it seems like Maegor would have at least named his wife, Rhaena, who had a stronger claim than Aerea or Jaehaerys. I know Maegor was a tyrant, but he didn't do things for no reason, and I'm having trouble understanding his reasoning here, any insight would be appreciated.",SPOILER
"My personal saddest would have to be Aegon the 3rd. After reading Fire and Blood it's so upsetting to see how broken he truly was and every time he ventured out of his shell he was put down by his hand of the King. 

The saddest thing about him for me personally is knowing he simply found joy in nothing, not even books or writing, he was a passenger in his own body. 

That's my main example, but Fire and Blood has really  made me feel so much more connected to the lore in general, the Dance of Dragons was heartbreaking in comparison to everything Jahaerys and Alyssane built up. ",SPOILER
Is there any explanation as to why the Kingsguard is forbid from harming the Royal Family (Mentioned by Baelor Breakspear before the Trial by Seven in The Hedge Knight) Yet the Kingsguard partakes in jousts against the royal family. (prime example Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar targaryen at the Tourney of Harrenhal). I'm not that privy to how dangerous jousts are but they can be dangerous.,SPOILER
"I remember reading and enjoying the Princess and the Queen/Rogue Prince. The history was fascinating. There were a few truly horrifying incidents, but nothing in the way of real tragedy or sadness. At least not for characters I felt any sympathy for. Once you know the details two generations back, that all changed.

&#x200B;

The siblings Aemon, Baelon, and Alyssa were all children of Jaehaerys and Alysanne. They rode the dragons Caraxes, Vhagar, and Meleys. We know Baelon and Aemon were best friends basically from birth. Baelon and Alyssa (setting aside how gross it is) was a genuinely sweet little love story. There's that cute anecdote about Baelon and then Alyssa in turn following their older siblings around everywhere. We know Baelon and Alyssa flew together frequently. Aemon and Baelon flew together at least into battle. I think it is safe to assume the three of them probably flew together for fun though as well.

&#x200B;

Then the Dance of the Dragons comes. Daemon Targaryen, riding Caraxes, kills his nephew Aemond riding Vhagar. The dragons of the two brothers, the best friends. They rode together into battle along with Vermithor and Jaehaerys and died forced to fight each other. Earlier and (in my opinion) even worse, Aemond flying on Vhagar (with the help of Aegon II on Sunfyre) kills Rhaenys on Meleys. Baelon's dragon killing Alyssa's. Baelon's grandson killing his brother/best friend's daughter. 

&#x200B;

I guess in theory I knew all of these people were related before. It never really struck home with me until Fire and Blood though.",SPOILER
Has Jorah ever used Longclaw in battle? I know that Longclaw was in his possession but I don't know how much he used it if ever. I was hoping he fought with it during the Greyjoy Rebellion. Thank you for the help. :) ,SPOILER
"## Aegon's Conquest: A MegaGame
---
Dallas MegaGames will be putting on a production of [Aegon's Conquest](https://www.pcgamer.com/this-game-of-thrones-tabletop-game-is-so-big-it-needs-33-players/) in Plano, Texas on **Saturday, March 9th!**

>*It is the Age of Conquest, three centuries before the events of Game of Thrones. Westeros stands as a fractured continent, with seven warring kingdoms jostling each other for power and dominance. A new power has invaded from Old Valyria, bringing with them fire and blood. The time is now ripe to establish yourselves as the strongest Kingdom of the realm and unite Westeros under your banner. Claim victory in this continent-spanning war and forge the Iron Throne!*

##What's this all about?
---
Aegon's Conquest is a medieval fantasy themed tabletop megagame, meaning that it is an interactive experience where a large number of players work either together or against each other to affect the greater storyline. Aegon's Conquest is a team-based competitive endeavor with tightly defined rules and player options. The game aligns its players into eight major factions of four players each with the ultimate goal to have the most points by the end. It encourages face-to-face diplomacy, tactical play, secret dealings, betrayal, and heartfelt roleplaying. The game is based on the history and deep lore as presented in the A Song of Ice & Fire literary series, though knowledge of the source material is not needed to play or run this game.  


In practice, the game plays like a combination of **Diplomacy**, **Settlers of Catan** and **Risk**. Players are separated into teams of four, each with distinct roles, and vie against other teams for the Iron Throne. 


Full rules for the game, created by /u/DefDanger can be found [here!](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/248012/Aegons-Conquest-MegaGame) (for free!)

##How do I get involved?

Tickets are on sale now, via [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aegons-conquest-a-megagame-tickets-53027742405).

Feel free to read up on the rules before showing up, but if you don't have time for that, the game is easy to learn and we'll be going over it with everyone as we get started.

"Tyrion. Rhaegar. Sam.

All big readers. Many characters in Westeros love a good book. But this begs the question of how books are distributed in Westeros.

This is probably one of the weirdest (and most useless) questions on the subreddit, but I was wondering whether books are copied by hand or Westeros has the printing press (invented in the c.1700, I believe)

Oh yeah, I haven't read the books yet (sorry). Big fan of the show, know stuff about the novels, going to crack into them asap.",SPOILER
"Elissa Farman in F&B is said to have sailed west on the sunset sea to find what is west of Westeros. Though she lost ships and some turned back, Corlys Velaryon swears to seeing a ship that could only be the '""Sun Chaser""ù. So it is possible she made the trip and survived.

I know it only happened in the show, but in s06 Arya talks about sailing west of Westeros, saying '""I'd like to see that""ù. She also shows an interest and aptitude for sailing, even wishing she could stay aboard the ship that brought her to Braavos. I know it's oretty flimsy evidence, but I believe that once all of the fights are fought, and her '""names""ù are gone, she will set sail for the sunset sea. She is clearly not some lords lady, and I don't believe she wishes to be a knight anymore after seeing the horrors of the Riverlands.

Also with the show bringing Gendry back, I think he will end up marrying Arya and serving her on the ship when she leaves.

Any thoughts or criticisms on the possibility of this happening is welcome.",SPOILER
"There is very little information on this island, even though at least a few important events occurred here. The pact of the first men and the CotF was signed here. Not even the andals were able to conquer this island. It's also heavily implied Howland Reed came here to visit with the green men. What do you think is on the island? Do you think maybe they are protecting something? I think whatever Howland discovered there is why he sent Jojen to Bran, and I think he has some kind of secret information that only he knows. Which would be why he has never left since he return back to greywater watch, not wanting to risk death or this information following into someone else's hands. I also believe this will be where the pact between the others and the living will be signed. I have no evidence for this, but I have been racking over what could be there for a week.

"I'm currently rereading the series and came across some interesting foreshadowing in ACOK Tyrion 5. To give some context this is the scene in which Cersei confronts Tyrion about shipping Myrcella off to Dorne. Most of you will remember during their heated exchange Cersei slaps Tyrion. When the scene is nearing it's conclusion Tyrion has this thought, ""Let her flay half my face, it will be a small price to pay for her to consent to the Dornish marriage."" I find this especially ironic considering not only does he get cut across the face but Myrcella does as well. 

I wanted to point this out and get all of your thoughts on it. Also, what are some other pieces of foreshadowing that you found noteworthy?",SPOILER
"I am actually kinda hoping that this is just something that I missed, but I was watching some youtube theories yesterday and it had a clip to the well known ""he kidnapped her and raped her"". 

If no one knew where Rhaegar took her, if not one knew what went down there, (outside of Ned and Howland), and no one knows there was actually a baby produced here, where does everyone get that she was raped? I get the kidnapped part from the outside looking in, but where do people get it that she was raped while in Rhaegars posession?

I'm sorry if this is a really stupid question with a really obvious answer, but Ive done rereads and Ive watched the seasons, and it just kinda hit me that there is no way to really know what happened when Lyanna was 'kidnapped' so why is everyone in Westeros so quick to say she was raped? I feel that is part of the reason that everyone looks so harshly on Rhaegar, not only did he kidnap her, but he raped her. Is it just some well accepted assumption that is now just taken as fact? Did Ned tell his family that she had been raped before he found her and I just missed it?

Be nice please lol like I said, it was just something that kinda hit me and Im wondering where this assumption came from or what i missed in the text.",SPOILER
"In Daenerys X, Dany is delirious with hunger and illness and hears voices through the whisper of the grass of the Dothraki Sea. The first is explicitly identified as Viserys, the third Jorah Mormont, but the second voice is more mysterious:

>""I am the blood of the dragon,"" she told the grass, aloud.

>Once, the grass whispered back, until you chained your dragons in the dark.

>""Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was ""¶ her name ""¶"" Dany could not recall the child's name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. ""I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.""

>Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children.

Who do you think this is supposed to be? Note that I'm not asking ""where do these voices originate?"" I think the answer to that is either Dany externalizing her inner monologue in her delirious state or Quaithe or someone else speaking to her through magic. 

What I'm asking is what do you think the identity of this second voice is supposed to be in the above context? I find it very weird that Martin explicitly identifies the first voice and the third voice but keeps the second voice anonymous.",SPOILER
"I keep on ongoing list of all the Houses mentioned in ASOIAF, and it seems to me that GRRM introduced a handful of new houses in *Fire & Blood: Vol 1*.

Here are the new houses I saw in *F&B* that I hadn't seen mentioned before. Sometimes it is hard to tell which names are official houses vs a hedge knight, so some of these may be taken with a grain of salt. Feel free to let me know if these had been mentioned somewhere before, or if you think of them as a hedge knight's title rather than a House.

**House Bush** - Ser Owen Bush of the Kingsuard

**House Stafford** - Ser Willam Stafford

**House Bullock** - Ser Merrell, Ser Alyn and Ser Howard Bullock

**House Scales** - Ser Elyas Scales of Dragonstone

**House Shaw** - Ser Robin Shaw of the Kingsguard

**House Largent** - Ser Luthor Largent, Commander of the City Watch

**House Correy** - Ser Qarl Correy of High Tide

**House Bourney** - Ser Owain Bourney

**House Grey** - Ser Garibald Grey

**House Hall** - Ser Garrick Hall

**House Corne** - Ser Roger Corne

**House Quince** - Ser Robert Quince of Dragonstone

**House Greysteel** - Ser Florian Greysteel of Maidenpool

**House True** - Ser Thoron True

**House Lansdale** - Ser Loreth Lansdale of the Queensguard

**House Wheaton** - Ser Warrick Wheaton - Gurm clearly added this to honor F&B's illustrator Doug Wheaton

**House Rodden** - Ser Richard Rodden of the Caltrops

**House Bentley** - Ser Lyonel Bentley of the Queensguard

**House Wormwood** - Ser Julian Wormwood

**House Weatherwax** - Lady Anya Weatherwax

**House Woodhull** - Lady Henrietta Woodhull of the Vale

**House Stillman** - Ser Russel Stillman

**House Crayne** - Ser Symond Crayne of the Vale - not to be confused with House Crane of the Reach

**House Dutton** of the Vale

**House Ruskyn** - Ser Raynard Ruskyn, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

**House Warrick** - Ser Edmund Warrick of the Kingsguard

**House Whitfield** - Ser Dennis Whitfield of the Kingsguard

**House Brownhill** - Ser Walter Brownhill

My first impression: it's rather a lot of new Houses. Of course since this is an in depth historical scope, it makes sense to see new houses we haven't heard of, many of which are likely to be irrelevant or extinct by the timeframe of ASOIAF proper. Gurm seems to rather enjoy adding new Houses and expanding his world it would seem, unless I'm giving this too much credit and Gurm just makes up the names without overthinking it. Regardless, I always think it's interesting to consider the Houses, and I've always really enjoyed his very English sounding House names.",SPOILER

"After spending far too much time on this sub reading crazy theories I noticed a lot of the more speculative ones have to do with the appearance of certain words - e.g the use of ""blood"" in the Jojen-Paste chapter. This got me wondering about how often certain words appear and in which PoVs. Being an unemployed programmer I got straight to the task of creating an app to calculate these numbers and graph it out!  


A few interesting things I found out:

* ""Promise"" appears 43 times in the Ned chapters of AGOT
* ""Wine"" is more common in Sansa chapters, than in Cersei's, but appears in Tyrion's more than the other two combined
* ""Hodor"" appears 515 times in the books, 499 times within Bran chapters
* ""Dragon"" appears most in Dany chapters, followed by Tyion and then Barristan
* ""Boiled Leather"" is used 65 times in the books (it felt like more...)

"The Valyrian dragons were war machines right? Whilst some bonded to the dragonlords in the same way as the Targ dragons do, i imagine most were enslaved using blood magic and dragonhorns. So, isn't it a bit impractical to have dragons grow to the size Balerion was at the end of his life? Just keeping it fed would be a nightmare. So do you think that Balerion got, too big? If so, what size do you reckon the average Valyrian dragon was?",SPOILER
"* Since GRRM confirmed that Jeyne Westerling will be in the Prologue of TWoW but she won't be the POV, most of the popular theories revolve around someone in the column being the Prologue POV, such as Forley Prester, or Ilyn Payne (who by the way is not reported to be in the column) or Sybell Spicer (who has always been my favorite). What if we are looking from the wrong way? What if the Prologue POV is someone from the rescuers? This would still allow Jeyne Westerling to be in the Prologue as GRRM promised.

* Edmure is already saved from captivity once, during the Battle of the Camps. If Blackfish saves him again, it would look silly. More importantly, GRRM put heavy emphasis on how Jaime is now a changed man who learned from his past mistakes like the Battle of the Camps. He doubled the escort at least twice and he gave strict orders that the prisoners are to be killed at the first sign of a rescue operation. I believe that none of the prisoners will be saved alive by the rescuers.

* For a POV inside the column, the Prologue will read like a travelogue for most of the time. Then the rescue will start and the prisoners will be killed. The rest is a bloody deathmatch. I don't think such an arrangement has enough meat to pass a story for the Prologue regardless of the POV character. However, for a person from the rescuers, there is a lot of potential to qualify as a Prologue POV. 

* It is important to realize that the Prologue cannot be considered in isolation. The Prologue has to segue into a certain part of the story. In the case of TWoW Prologue with Jeyne's confirmed presence, the chapter can only be connected to Westerlands or Riverlands. But the Westerlands option would be starting a new thread while GRRM has already excessive threads on the table. Riverlands is very late in the timeline and using the Prologue to propel the Riverlands story forward would be the best option. As a result, using someone from the Brotherhood or even Blackfish as the Prologue POV would greatly benefit the story and it can naturally follow from there to Jaime/Brienne chapters.

* Another important thing with this Prologue tease is that GRRM also talked about how he mislikes being predictable. If people start thinking that he has a pattern with the Prologue and Epilogue characters (like killing them for example) he would like to break that pattern. **My favorite TWoW Prologue POV is now Blackfish.** 

* There is the possibility of a conflict between Blackfish and Lady Stoneheart. There are two missions but which one will have priority? At one hand, there is the rescue of Edmure and Jeyne. '""Family, Duty, Honor""ù as in Tully words dictate that they should prioritize saving Edmure. At the other hand, there is the Red Wedding 2.0 at Riverrun. This option is neither family, nor duty nor honor. It is only revenge. Lady Stoneheart is likely to prioritize the bloody surprise at Riverrun over saving Edmure (based on the foreshadowing that '""no man""ù will take Riverrun from Emmon Frey). This will cause division among the brotherhood, as some are already discontent with Lady Stoneheart's leadership. 

* Blackfish knows the goat track of Grey Wind through which he can enter Westerlands and set the trap there. Because of the division among the brotherhood, he will not have as much men as he wanted and this will be one of the primary reasons for the failure. When he returns with the survivors, there will surely be an even more heated discussion among the brotherhood.",SPOILER
"In Arya XII, ASoS we hear this slander from Polliver about Sansa Stark and the Purple Wedding:

>""I forgot, you've been hiding under a rock. **The northern girl. Winterfell's daughter. We heard she killed the king with a spell, and afterward changed into a wolf with big leather wings like a bat, and flew out a tower window.** But she left the dwarf behind and Cersei means to have his head.""

This puts into mind something we hear of Danelle Lothston in Brienne II, AFFC:

>""All castles,"" said the captain's sister. ""The only one I know is the Dun Fort by the harbor. I made t'other in my head, what a castle ought to look like. I never seen a dragon neither, nor a griffin, nor a unicorn."" She had a cheerful manner, but when Brienne showed her the shield her face went dark. ""**My old ma used to say that giant bats flew out from Harrenhal on moonless nights, to carry bad children to Mad Danelle for her cookpots. Sometimes I'd hear them scrabbling at the shutters.**"" She sucked her teeth a moment, thoughtful. ""What goes in its place?""

Both these descriptions conjure up very witch-like imagery, with bats often associated with the darker aspects of the occult and being familiars to witches due to their nocturnal nature. To further the witch connotations, Sansa is also noted in the quote about her to cast a ""spell"", and we know at some point Danelle turned to the ""dark arts"".

The bat imagery in Sansa's case connects to her Whent ancestry through her maternal grandmother Minisa Whent, whose family sigil featured nine bats on yellow. The Whent sigil is in and of itself connected to the Lothston sigil, as the Whents were originally knights in service to House Lothston, whose sigil is a black bat on yellow and white. There are further connections between Sansa and Danelle Lothston in this regard, as the Whents were rewarded Harrenhal, which the Lothstons had previously held, for their role in defeating the Mad Danelle.

The connections in regards to Harrenhal continue as Sansa is now currently posing as the bastard daughter of Petyr Baelish, Alayne Stone. Petyr Baelish is now the current Lord of Harrenhal and Danelle was a previous Lady of Harrenhal.

When leaving Harrenhal, Brienne is given a shield with the bat of house Lothston on it. Brienne uses this shield whilst on her quest to find Sansa Stark, though she later gets it repainted at Duskendale due to the sigils ill-repute.

It should be noted that both Sansa and Danelle have similar hair colors. With Danelle having had red hair and Sansa having the auburn hair of House Tully.

I would also like to point out that bats are used as a symbol of Persephone, the Greek Goddes of Spring and Queen of the Underworld. This is due to bats also functioning as a symbol of death and rebirth.

Sansa has a clear association with Persephone when she rejects the pomegranate offered to her by Littlefinger. In the myth of Persephone's Abduction, she is offered a pomegranate by Hades, who should be noted was also the God of Wealth mirroring Littlefinger as Master of Coin.

Persephone's moniker of 'Queen of the Underworld' could apply to Danelle, considering how often ghosts and death are associated with Harrenhal, Danelle's seat of power.",SPOILER
"Or who would have/be the most fun with it? I think it'd be kind of funny to see what Euron would do with such power, or whether that power might spur Doran Martell to action.

If Rhaegar or someone fighting alongside him had it at the battle of the trident, would we even have a story? Would the four-legs and siege capabilities of the ATAT fare better in Essos? If it can mysteriously travel really quickly like some characters, would this change your choice?

Obviously this comes with the little asterisk of: somehow nobody questions its metal, technological nature, just writes it off as '""well that's a fuckhuge archon of destruction.""ù Also anybody you give it to knows how to operate it and it can be operated by a one-man crew. At the end of the month it poofs out of existence, but your chosen character is perfectly aware of that and can thusly plan to dispose of it.

"Shadows play an important role in determining the moral compass of the character. The greater the shadow the more important the character will be and vice versa if the character has a small shadow they will do evil things or don't have much longer to live, also shadows mainly foreshadow the destiny of the character. Sorry if someone posted about this before.

The main evidence is cited by Melisandre in the fifth book:¬†

*in our joining \[male and female\] there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast¬†shadows""¶.Every man who¬†walks the earth casts a shadow on the world. Some are thin and¬†death, others are long and dark. You should look behind you Lord Snow. The moon has kissed you¬†and/or shadow upon the ice twenty feet tall.*

*Jon Snow as we all know plays a key role in the series.* 

Tormund, states to Jon before entering the wall, ""ùShadows never go way. Might be you don't see them, but they're always clinging to your heels""ù

A key line in the first book Game of Thrones is when Jon is watching Tyrion enter the great hall of Winterfell, he saw his shadow and it was an image of a great king. (paraphrasing). This foreshadows Tyrion's greatness and his destiny to play a large part in the Game of Thrones.¬†

Tyrion's shadow is mentioned again when the Red Priest Moqorro, accused of him of being, '""a small man with a big shadow, snarling the midst of all.""ù

Then Moqorro states, \[looking into the fires the most common theme\] '""One most of all. A tall and twisted thing with one black eye and ten long arms, sailing on a sea of blood""ù Clearly he is talking about Euron Greyjoy (one eye) and his tentacles (A giant squid is the house sigil).¬†

Stannis uses his shadow to kill his Brother Renly, this is a true act of evil and it is represented in the books later on in the fifth book when Stannis shadow, '""The pit fire was burning low, and king's shadow on the Wall had shrunk to a quarter of its former height.""ù Also it could mean his time is almost up.¬†

Furthermore from Asha's point of view, said, '""This king lives in his brother's shadow""

In the King Breaker Chapter Skahaz mo Kandaq and Barristan Selmy meet, '""A pale shadow and a dark, the two conspirators came together in the quiet of the armory ¬†on the Great Pyramid's second level""¶""ù It never clarifies which shadow is which.¬†

This scene then cuts to one of Walder Frey eating and the subtitle (rats squeaking). I thought this was great foreshadowing of Walder Frey as the '""rat king""ù being fed his son in a meat pie before being killed later on.",SPOILER
"What do we make of the fact that castle black has no Godswood, forcing a dangerous venture north of the wall for any recruits who follow the old gods? The Nights Watch is traditionally manned pretty heavily by Northerners, despite the fact that Jon's class of recruits seems pretty light on followers of the old gods. 

The tinfoil answer that comes to mind is that the Night's Watch didn't want the Weirwood Net/Children of the Forest to have eyes behind their defenses. I'm always on the lookout for reasons not to trust the CotF, and this struck me as a possible example. Similar to the way that the Starks are buried in crypts, meaning they don't get incorporated into the Weirwood net, unlike the Kings of the first men who were buried in barrows. 

The two non-tinfoil explanations that occurred to me are that a) Castle black isn't much of a castle (no walls, falling to pieces, etc) and this is just another example of it being purely utilitarian and not having any amenities beyond what is absolutely necessary, or b) the NW used to be a lot stronger and the venture north of the wall wasn't as risky in the past. 

Anyway, what do you guys think?

"Sandor Clegane, otherwise known as the Hound, is introduced in A Game of Thrones by way of his namesake helmet:

>A shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming overhead like a cliff. His soot-dark armor seemed to blot out the sun. He had lowered the visor on his helm. It was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound, fearsome to behold, but Tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over Clegane's hideously burned face. (AGOT, Tyrion I)

&#x200B;

The show's armor designers took this very literally, creating this iconic helmet with a realistic canine visage.

[Sandor Clegane. Courtesy of YouTube.](https://i.redd.it/agz3nohplme21.png)

As an amateur student of medieval art and history, I got to wondering if this was anywhere close to what medieval craftspeople could have rendered. The following is not a criticism of the show's design; Westeros is a fantasy world enriched by magic and is not beholden to earth-history. This is a quick reflection on the art and armor of the middle ages.

&#x200B;

# Medieval Animals are ... Not Very Realistic

This is something you come to realize very quickly when presented with medieval manuscripts. Sure, the people appear stiff and goofy, and they often drew babies like miniature versions of adults.

[Stannis, is that you? No, it's an illuminated Adoration of the Magi from a 13th century psalter, W√ºrzburg, Germany. Courtesy of the Getty Museum.](https://i.redd.it/oo64jsrfnme21.jpg)

But medieval animals are enough to make you do a spit-take.

[These are--checks notes--elephants? Rochester Bestiary, c 13th-14th c. Courtesy of the British Library.](https://i.redd.it/lccqrwdc5ne21.jpg)

You have to imagine, the monks creating these manuscripts, by hand, inside of their cloistered monastery walls, couldn't walk down to the local zoo to catch a glimpse of a real elephant. They had to work with hides and tusks and second-hand accounts of people who had seen elephants, and then fill in the details. That's how you end up with depictions of exotic monkeys like this:

[Month of July with Leo. 'Bedford Hours' c 1410-1430. Courtesy of British Library.](https://i.redd.it/skmki0v0wme21.jpg)

Wait, the astrological sign Leo? So it's a lion, not a monkey?

Oh. Yup, definitely lions.

[These guys look as inbred as the Lannisters, am I right?  French, 16th c. Courtesy of Biblioth√®que nationale de France.](https://i.redd.it/15zkftevxme21.jpg)

So, you can imagine that if educated monks working in ink produce these likenesses, an armorer working in steel might not be able to capture a lifelike snarling hound in helmet form.

What did manuscript versions of medieval dogs look like? Glad you asked.

[ Cosmographie universelle, 1555. Courtesy of Biblioth√®que nationale de France.](https://i.redd.it/4jny6u07vme21.jpg)

But seriously, here are two blog posts from the British Library with many more depictions of the dog in medieval art.

[Dogs: Medieval Man's Best Friend](https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2013/09/dogs-medieval-mans-best-friend.html)

[Nothin' but a Hound Dog](https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2013/02/nothin-but-a-hound-dog.html)

[ Even when they're eating humans, they're smiling. A dog attacking its master's killer, c 1250. Courtesy of the British Library.](https://i.redd.it/92rbkxtjtme21.jpg)

Dogs were ubiquitous and important in the middle ages. They were used for hunting, herding, protection, war, racing, and companionship. We find depictions of dogs in medieval statuary as well. Dogs were commonly depicted on tomb effigies, lying under the feet of their masters. Good boys, all of them.

[Medieval English Alabaster Tomb Sculpture of a Hound Dog Seated on a Carved Mail Ground. Courtesy of Finch & Co Antiquities.](https://i.redd.it/v4hm27z0ume21.jpg)

But despite being three-dimensional, these dogs are more similar to their medieval 2-D counterparts than to the Hound's fierce helm above.

[Boop. Courtesy of Canterbury Cathedral.](https://i.redd.it/1pjeww1nvme21.jpg)

We cannot escape the possibility, however, that dogs in the middle ages were actually that ridiculous--just as their modern counterparts remain.

[The author's dog as a medieval effigy.](https://i.redd.it/rmx7enilume21.jpg)

# Animals as Armor

In medieval Europe, as in Westeros, animals were common heraldic motifs, and they were no less goofy-looking when painted onto shields or fashioned into helms. Oh yes, there was a period of time in the middle ages when knights would go all out, fashioning crests for their helm that imitated the art on their coat of arms.

[And you thought the Knight of the Flowers was extra. Courtesy of Biblioth√®que nationale de France.](https://i.redd.it/nvgxizsirme21.jpg)

The first helm in that example above is a hound. Is this what GRRM was thinking of when he wrote the Hound's description? I don't think so, because he describes the visage of the snarling hound immediately after noting that Clegane had lowered his visor. Everyone seems to interpret this as the helmet, and the visor itself, were fashioned into a hound's face. Turns out we might have some examples of that, too.

[German Helmet c 1520-1530. Courtesy of The State Hermitage Museum.](https://i.redd.it/5anv6droyme21.jpg)

The description of this helm did not identify which animal it was modeled after, but if you look at the image of ~~the monkey~~ Leo above, it is very similar to medieval depictions of lions. When the medieval mind thought of ""snarling lion,"" this was probably what came to mind. They would see this helm and imagine a beast, ready to bite your right arm off.

After an exhaustive search for historical hound helms, there was one image that kept appearing and was hard to track down a source for. I finally found an [auction site](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/26304325_-a-german-close-helmet-with-dog-faced-visor-in-the) that had it listed, and the original appears to also hail from 1520s Germany. So, if you're looking for authentic animal helms, that's where you should set the coordinates of your time machine.

[He had lowered the visor on his helm, and yeah, it was fearsome to behold.](https://i.redd.it/stf9ml970ne21.jpg)

# A Different, More Mundane, Historical Inspiration?

So, when I first searched for ""hound helm,"" the results kept turning up these pretty standard medieval helms called basinets. Some sources were calling the ones with conical visors ""pig faced."" But it turns out [this style of basinet was also called a ""hounskull"" after the German hundsgugel meaning ""hound's hood.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bascinet#Hounskull)"" Behold:

[Courtesy of the Higgins Armory Museum, which I highly recommend if you're ever unfortunate enough to find yourself in Worcester, Massachusetts.](https://i.redd.it/ng56rekz1ne21.jpg)

[You could say it's a Basinet Hound. No? 15thc \(probably\) German. Courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.](https://i.redd.it/wohyap5w3ne21.jpg)

Does this helmet look like a snarling dog, staring you down on the battlefield? Maybe not literally, but I could see if you had a group of guys sporting these that they could look like a pack of hounds; enough so that it coined a description that we still use 700 years later. Is it possible that this simple and prolific style of helm is the actual inspiration for the Hound's iconic armor? I think there's a good chance. But I do enjoy the dorky medieval aesthetic compared to the realism of 21st century prestige-drama costuming, don't you?",SPOILER
"Making my way through Fire and Blood so if these have already been discussed before, apologies in advanced.

Baelon was clearly assassinated, dying of a ruptured stomach during the prime of his life. With other characters such as Maegor and Septon Moon, the Maester write a handful of conjectures and speculations of their deaths. Baelon got like two sentences. Gyldayn seems really dismissive of the whole thing. It makes me wonder if the Tyroshi really was aiming for Aemon.

The realm prospered under Jaeherys and the princes were beloved by all. Is having the Dance and the Blackfyre rebellions, which caused so much death and destruction throughout the realm really worth it to the Faith and Citadel because of their anti-dragon bias? Who knows how the realm might have turned out.",SPOILER

" I am currently working on another post about the swords in the Crypts of Winterfell and I noticed something I hadn't previously with regards to the swords Bran and co. take with them.

Meera Reed takes Lord Rickard Stark's sword:

>**Meera had claimed Lord Rickard's blade**, though she complained that it was too heavy.

Bran takes his uncle Brandon's sword:

>**Brandon took his namesake's, the sword made for the uncle he had never known**. He knew he would not be much use in a fight, but even so the blade felt good in his hand.

What I hadn't noticed is that Osha takes Ned's sword:

>Osha carried her long oaken spear in one hand and the torch in the other. **A naked sword hung down her back**, one of the last to bear Mikken's mark. **He had forged it for Lord Eddard's tomb**, to keep his ghost at rest.

Considering Osha left with Rickon, she would still have that sword with her. The one we see Hodor use is noted as being much older so it couldn't be the same one.

Also, this sword is one of the very last to bear Mikken's mark before he was killed by the Ironborn:

>A naked sword hung down her back, **one of the last to bear Mikken's mark. He had forged it for Lord Eddard's tomb**, to keep his ghost at rest. **But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the armory**, good steel had been hard to resist, even if it meant grave-robbing.

Historically, a blacksmith's mark was akin to a painters signature on their work. Blacksmiths would use various symbols as a means to identify their work, as a brand. So Mikken's mark could lend legitimacy to Rickon's claim through this sword.

I've often seen it said that the Shaggydog will be used as a way of proving Rickon's identity, which is almost certain, but I could see Ned's tomb sword also being used to further add legitimacy to Rickon's claim.",SPOILER

So assuming that Sarella was not the Sphinx Aemon was referring to, who or what could it be?

" 

We are all familiar with the delicious tinfoil theory about ASOIAF being secretly a sci-fi story set in the thousand worlds universe.

If you haven't heard of it, look it up, it's highly entertaining.

The theory states Planetos is a technologically regressed planet that was devastated during the human/hrangan war, and searches for evidence to support this claim in GRRM's former works, which are mostly sci-fi.

Even though the creativity of the theory can't be denied, it's also hard to deny it is a far-fetched interpretation exptrapolated from the many similarities between ASOIAF and GRRM's former, sci-fi, writings.

But there is one thing the theory makes certain: there are MANY parallels between GRRM's sci-fi works and ASOIAF. Not only names of characters, but also certain key themes, such as, just to name a few: abnormally long winters (bitterblooms), dream sending creatures (and seven times never kill man), hive mind existences (song for lya), even GREEN DREAMS are mentioned at a certain point in Tuf Voyaging.

So it's pretty clear GRRM likes to recycle his ideas, especially his most involved ones.

And that takes us to the title.

One of the key aspects of the thousand worlds universe was how the extinct Ecological Egineering Corps could produce genetic engineered monsters to wage war against the hrangans. These genetic altered monstrosities would terrorize technologically regressed planets long after their creators ceased to exist, and, in many situations, would reproduce and persevere.

The monsters would sometimes be half human hybrids, like the ""grouns"" in the story ""In the house of the worm"".

And that takes us to the point: what organization in ASOIAF is known to play with life in a similar way, creating ""chimaeras"" through the use of ""blood magic""?

That's right.

It's been constantly repeated, including in ""Fire and Blood"", that valyrians were not ""only dragonlords"". And, in said book, we have a jarring passage in which Aerea Targaryen supposedly visited the ruins of old Valyria, only to return ""pregnant"", burning from the inside out, with ""things"" inside her that were described as ""worms with faces"" and ""snakes with hands"".

Notice the human aspect mixed with the animal one. They were ""worms"" and ""snakes"", but had ""faces"" and ""hands"", they were also, seemingly, in Aerea's womb (as suggested by the smoke coming from inside her parts).

In that respect, furthering the notion that GRRM recycles his ideas, we can assume ""blood magic"" is no more than genetic engineering translated to a fantasy setting, which raises very interesting questions about the true nature of dragons. For instance, their constant association with fire is obvious enough, but they are also associated with blood and magic. What could that mean?

In a similar note, Valyrians in general, an Targaryens in particular, are constantly said to be ""of dragon blood"", and there are recurring instances of Targaryens birthing dragonlike monstrosities. It's almost like a part of their ""blood"" is, truly, that of a dragon, and they share with dragons a weird form of blood relationship, almost like they are kin.

Or, in a wild speculation, maybe the dragons we know are chimaeras created from the fusion of Valyrian people and other creatures through blood magic, maybe even intermingling those ""chimerical dragons"" life cycles with that of valyrians by altering valyrian blood in several ways, making them closer to dragons. In this way, dragons would be, literally, related by blood to certain valyrians families in a sick manner, and most valyrians capable of dragon taming would, also, be chimaeras themselves.

It's also stated that valyrians are more resilient to disease and pestilence than a regular person. So were the chiefs of the Eco Engineering Corps. Another interesting parallel.

So what do you think about all that? I'll post a continuation later, associating the children of the forest with the hrangans, and showing what, i believe, were signs of a war between them and Valyria.",SPOILER
"It's pretty well known that GRRM isn't big on absolute good or evil, so maybe that conclusion makes sense, but I think it's worth mentioning that we're told as much in the world book. 

>When the daughter of the Opal Emperor succeeded him as the Amethyst Empress, **her envious younger brother cast her down and slew her, proclaiming himself the Bloodstone Emperor and** ***beginning a reign of terror*****.** ***He practiced dark arts, torture, and necromancy, enslaved his people, took a tiger-woman for his bride, feasted on human flesh,*** **and cast down the true gods to worship a black stone that had fallen from the sky.** (Many scholars count the Bloodstone Emperor as the first High Priest of the sinister Church of Starry Wisdom, which persists to this day in many port cities throughout the known world). *-The Bones and Beyond: Yi-TI, TWOIAF*  
>  
>....  
>  
>In the annals of the Further East, **it was the Blood Betrayal, as his usurpation is named, that ushered in the age of darkness called the Long Night.** ***Despairing of the evil that had been unleashed on earth*****,** the Maiden-Made-of-Light turned her back upon the world, **and the Lion of Night came forth in all his wroth** ***to punish the wickedness of men.*** *-The Bones and Beyond: Yi-TI, TWOIAF*

The Long Night was ushered *in response to* some ""evil that had been unleashed on the earth"". The enemy that came forth during the Long Night did so in order to ""*punish the wickedness of men"".* 

In the east, this enemy is called the Lion of Night. It's not entirely certain that the Lion of Night is related to the Others, but it would be a little odd for so many cultures to have Long Night myths with enemies that came forth from a global darkness, and have the enemies each culture faced be different. Also, the description of this enemy from the east sounds a lot like the Others and their wights, or perhaps more likely, the Great Other and the Others. 

>The Five Forts are very old, older than the Golden Empire itself; some claim they were raised by the Pearl Emperor during the morning of the Great Empire to keep **the Lion of Night and his demons** from the realms of men...and indeed, there is something godlike, or demonic, about the monstrous size of the forts... *-The Bones and Beyond: Yi-TI, TWOIAF*

The first Long Night wasn't random, and it happened in response to some great sin and an evil that spread across the world. And the demons of the Lion of Night came forth ""*to punish the wickedness of men*"". 

*If* the Long Night myths from the east have any relevance to Westeros at all, the Others are not evil. Quite the contrary, they come *in response* to something humanity has done, some great sin, and they aim to cleanse it from the world. 

This also has implications for the story of Azor Ahai as well. In the myths from the east, the Bloodstone Emperor and his followers were ultimately the evil ones in the situation. And the Lion of Night came to cleanse their evil from the world. The victory of the Lion of Night would have constituted the removal of their ""wickedness"" from the world. So then Azor Ahai defeating the demons of the Lion of Night prevented them from cleansing the world of the Bloodstone Emperor's sin. 

This might also be the reason that another Long Night is inevitable. The evil unleashed by the Bloodstone Emperor and his followers still exists, having been saved from destruction by Azor Ahai, and the Others still strive to cleanse the world of this evil. ",SPOILER
"Varys, Doran, Littlefinger, Illyrio, Tywin are some of the characters people consider to be the most intelligent in the series. Who do you think is the smartest character we've seen in the story so far?

My pick would have to be Littlefinger. He's managed to work his way from son of a minor lord to Lord of Harrenhal, Lord Paramount of the Riverlands, Regent to Sweetrobin, and Lord Protector of the Vale. He's managed to amass a spy network that rivals Varys, orchestrated a war that has left most of the realm in chaos, bought most of the Lords of the Vale (which is one of only two unspent armies), and holds Sansa Stark the *apparent* key to the North. This is a man with no military prowess or lands or titles who has worked his way up to becoming one of the most powerful men in Westeros by pure cunning.",SPOILER
"Hi! 

I have started listening to ASOIAF audiobooks and I love them! I normally just read the books and enjoy them, but I just finished the part in clash of Kings where Jaqen H'ghar helps Arya free the north prisoners and then leaves her. It seems that he is a warlock and now I just have to ask: does Arya ever learn magic from him (or anyone else)? I absolutely love the series and need to know!",SPOILER
"House Dayne is another noble house and their members are often noted for their Valariyan features. Furthermore, they are completely removed from the ""great game"" and have no ambitions beyond their regional seat. Why did the mad king not consider Ashara Dayne over Elia Martell?",SPOILER
"Isn't strange that Stannis calls Theon a turncloak in Winds?

From Stannis's point of view, Robb was rebel against him, so Theon's betrayal shouldn't be bad thing.",SPOILER
"Melisandre worships the Lord of Light. As the name implies, this Lord of Light is understood to be male.

>To R'hllor, the **Lord of Light**, may **he** defend us all! One land, one god, one king!"" *-Jon X, ADwD*  
>  
>...when **R'hllor** reached out **his** hand his prayers turned to screams, and he burned. *-Davos III, ASoS*  
>  
>You doubt the truth of **R'hllor** even now . . . yet have **served** ***him*** all the same, and will **serve** ***him*** again. *-Davos III, ASoS*  
>  
>You heard me ask **R'hllor** to take a hand, and you saw ***his*** **fiery finger** snap Lord Beric's sword, just as he was about to make an end of it. The Lord of Light is not yet done with Joffrey's Hound, it would seem."" *-Arya VII, ASoS*  
>  
>""**R'hllor** chooses such instruments as **he** requires."" The ruby at Melisandre's throat shone redly. ""His ways are mysterious, but no man may withstand his fiery will."" *-Davos V, ASoS*

I could go on, but I'm sure you get the picture.

So R'hllor is a fiery male god. Simple enough religion, right? Not quite. Melisandre herself refers to the Lord of Light as male, but she also has a somewhat lengthy diatribe about the fundamental workings of the world that is squarely at odds with this male/fire association.

>""What is it you would have me see?""  
>  
>""The way the world is made. The truth is all around you, plain to behold. ***The night*** **is dark and full of terrors,** ***the day*** **bright and beautiful and full of hope. One is black, the other white.** ***There is ice and there is fire***. Hate and love. Bitter and sweet. ***Male and female.*** **Pain and pleasure.** ***Winter and summer***. Evil and good."" She took a step toward him. ""Death and life. Everywhere, opposites. Everywhere, the war.""  
>  
>""The war?"" asked Davos.  
>  
>""The war,"" she affirmed. ""**There are two**, Onion Knight. **Not seven, not one, not a hundred or a thousand.** ***Two!*** Do you think I crossed half the world to put yet another vain king on yet another empty throne? The war has been waged since time began, and before it is done, all men must choose where they will stand. On one side is R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror. Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister, between Greyjoy and Stark. It is death we choose, or life. Darkness, or light."" She clasped the bars of his cell with her slender white hands. The great ruby at her throat seemed to pulse with its own radiance. ""So tell me, Ser Davos Seaworth, and tell me truly""îdoes your heart burn with the shining light of R'hllor? Or is it black and cold and full of worms?"" She reached through the bars and laid three fingers upon his breast, as if to feel the truth of him through flesh and wool and leather. *-Davos III, ASoS*

Melisandre refers to two gods, one of ice and the other of fire, one of night and the other of day. The problem here is that while R'hllor is ostensibly a male god of fire, here Melisandre seems to associate fire with femininity instead.

One of Melisandre's two is: ""**night, dark**, black, **ice**, hate, bitter, **male**, pain, **winter**, and evil""

While the other is: ""**day, bright,** white, **fire,** love, sweet, **female,** pleasure, **summer,** and good""

She associates femininity with fire, summer, light, and daytime; all those things that we would think would fall under the purview of the male R'hllor.

So what are your thoughts on why this is? Certainly we don't know whether or not Melisandre's religion is true, but you would think that it would be at least self-consistent. Is there any relevance to the story of the Great Empire of the Dawn, which also seems to share this male-ice & female-fire duality? This myth does feature the downfall of this fiery female goddess, after all; ie, is the Lord of Light the Bloodstone Emperor? Does this discrepancy have anything to do with the dothraki sun god and moon goddess, or the Qartheen story of a second moon? Is assigning genders to ice and fire a fruitless endeavor, and I'm reading too much into it?

What's your opinion? Why does Melisandre worship a fiery male god, and yet also describe a fundamental association between fire and femininity as ""the way the world is made""?",SPOILER

# Foreshadowing in Fire & Blood

This is a compilation of possible hints that foreshadow future events for the main series. Much and more has been speculated over the years of these reigns when Twoiaf, the Princess and the Queen, Rogue prince and the Sons of the dragons came out, so  I'm just going to focus on new stuff that came out in Fire and blood.

# Battle of blood theory :

>Not all ironborn accepted his claim, however. On Old Wyk, under the bones of Nagga the Sea Dragon, the priests of the Drowned God placed a driftwood crown on the head of one of their own, the barefoot holy man Lodos, who proclaimed himself the living son of the Drowned God and was said to be able to work miracles. Other claimants arose on Great Wyk, Pyke, and Orkmont, and for more than a year their adherents battled one another on land and sea. **It was said that the waters between the islands were so choked with corpses that krakens appeared by the hundreds, drawn by the blood.**  
>  
>(""¶)On Old Wyk, the priest-king Lodos, purported son of the Drowned God, **called upon the krakens of the deep to rise and drag down the invaders' ships.**

&#x200B;

Seems like Euron is summoning an Army of krakens to destroy the Redwyne fleet.

# Harys Swyft¬¥s  fate:

# 

>The mission to Braavos proved eventful in other ways as well. Lord Follard became enamored of a Braavosi courtesan and elected to remain close to her rather than return to Westeros, **Ser Herman Rollingford was killed in a duel by a bravo who took offense at the color of his doublet,** and Ser Denys Harte supposedly engaged the services of the mysterious Faceless Men to kill a rival back in King's Landing,

This one is pretty clear. If you don¬¥t know the theory, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2mskkc/spoilers_all_a_swift_end_in_braavos/):

# Cersei the Mad Queen:

&#x200B;

Much and more has been said of the parallelisms of Cersei and Queen Rhaenyra. By the end of her reign Rhaenyra is plagued by a series of fake kings and rebels that take over the city forcing her to flee. One of those is a one-arm prophet who reminds us of the High Sparrow. In Fire and Blood we get much more detail on him.

>Grand Maester Munkun suggests he might have been a Poor Fellow; though that order had long been outlawed, wandering Stars still haunted the byways of the Seven Kingdoms.(""¶)  
>  
>Maesters and other scholars writing of this time oft take their cue from Munkun and speak of the Moon of the Three Kings (other scholars prefer the Moon of Madness), but this is a misnomer, as the Shepherd never claimed kingship, styling himself a simple son of the Seven.  
>  
>(...)  
>  
>With the dragons dead and the threat of immolation no longer imminent, the prophet turned his wroth upon the highborn and wealthy. Only the poor and humble would ever see the halls of the gods, he declared; lords and knights and rich men would be cast down in their pride and avarice to hell. '""Cast off your silks and satins, and clothe your nakedness in roughspun robes,""ù he told his followers. '""Throw away your shoes, and walk barefoot through the world, as the Father made you.

&#x200B;

The Shepherd is described as a prophet numerous times, and he made at least two predictions that come out true:

>When he spied Lord Borros on his warhorse, the Shepherd pointed his stump at him and cursed him. '""We shall meet in hell before this year is done,""ù the begging brother proclaimed.  
>  
>(""¶)  
>  
>'""We shall meet in hell before this year is done,""ù the same words he had spoken to Borros Baratheon upon his capture. For that insolence, Aegon had the Shepherd's tongue torn out with hot pincers, then condemned him and his '""treasonous followers""ù to death by fire.

&#x200B;

Anyways, the Shepherd is constantly preaching on how the city is doomed, and will be destroyed because of the sins of the targaryens, but most of all because of their dragons. The only solution is to kill them,.. and so he does, He convinces the masses to assault the dragonpit and kill the beasts sending hundreds to their deaths in the process. That said, the wording of his prophecies are very interesting:

>But that prophet answered, '""**When the dragons come, your flesh will burn and blister and turn to ash. Your wives will dance in gowns of fire, shrieking as they burn, lewd and naked underneath the flames. And you shall see your little children weeping, weeping till their eyes do melt and slide like jelly down their faces, till their pink flesh falls black and crackling from their bones.** The Stranger comes, *he comes, he comes,* to scourge us for our sins. Prayers cannot stay his wroth, **no more than tears can quench the flame of dragons**. Only blood can do that. Your blood, my blood, *their* blood.""ù Then he raised his right arm and jabbed the stump of his missing hand at Rhaenys's Hill behind him, at the Dragonpit black against the stars. '""There the demons dwell, up there. *Fire and blood, blood and fire*. This is their city. If you would make it yours, first must you destroy them. If you would cleanse yourself of sin, first must you bathe in dragon's blood. For only blood can quench the fires of hell.""ù  
>  
>(""¶)  
>  
>'""The false king and the whore queen shall be cast down with all their works, and their demon beasts shall perish from the earth,""ù the Shepherd thundered. All those who stood with them would die as well. **Only by cleansing King's Landing of dragons and their masters could Westeros hope to avoid the fate of Valyria.**

&#x200B;

He seems to be preaching about the destruction of Kings landing by fire, when the dragons come. This is particularly interesting, because of the theory of Mad Queen Cersei, which predicts that Cersei will go Full King Aerys and burn the city with Wildfire to deny Daenerys her throne. For some readers is daenerys who should loom over as threat for Cersei to do this, (given Younger more beautiful queen threat), others claim this will happen after Aegon defeats the Tyrells.. But notice the next quote:

>When a septa in the crowd cried out, pleading for him to save the city, the Shepherd said, '""Only the Mother's mercy can save you, but you drove your Mother from this city with your pride and lust and avarice. **Now it is the Stranger who comes. On a dark horse with burning eyes he comes, a scourge of fire in his hand** to cleanse this pit of sin of demons and all who bow before them. Listen! **Can you hear the sound of burning hooves? He comes! He comes!!""ù**  
>  
>**The crowd took up the cry, wailing,** ***'""He comes! He comes!!""ù*** **as a thousand torches filled the square** with pools of smoky yellow light.

&#x200B;

The Stranger is the god of death. Described here to ride a '""dark horse with burning eyes""ù. This could very well mean Drogon. Furthermore, this '""he comes""ù, '""he comes""ù, '""sound of burning hooves""ù, seem akin to the prophecy of the Stallion who mounts the world:

>*'""Khalakka dothrae mr'anha!""ù* she proclaimed in her best Dothraki. *A prince rides inside me!* She had practiced the phrase for days with her handmaid Jhiqui.  
>  
>The oldest of the crones, a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye, raised her arms on high. *'""Khalakka dothrae!""ù* she shrieked. ***The prince is riding!***  
>  
>***'""He is riding!""ù*** the other women answered.  
>  
>(""¶)  
>  
>**'""The thunder of his hooves!""ù** the others chorused.  
>  
>'""As swift as the wind **he rides**,

&#x200B;

IMHO this is evidence that it must be daenerys, and not Aegon and his queen (Arianne) that looms as a threat over kings landing for Cersei to go full Mad Queen.Anyways, the Storming of the Dragonpit ends like this:

&#x200B;

>Mushroom was amongst those watching with Queen Rhaenyra on the roof of Maegor's Holdfast. '""A thousand shrieks and shouts echoed across the city, mingling with the dragon's roar,""ù he tells us. '""Atop the Hill of Rhaenys, **the Dragonpit wore a crown of yellow fire, burning so bright it seemed as if the sun was rising**. **Even the queen trembled as she watched, the tears glistening on her cheeks. Never have I seen a sight more terrible, more glorious.""ù**  
>  
>Many of the queen's companions on the rooftop fled, the dwarf tells us, **fearing that the fires would soon engulf the entire city, even the Red Keep atop Aegon's High Hill**. Others took themselves to the castle sept to pray for deliverance. **Rhaenyra herself wrapped her arms about her last living son, Aegon the Younger, clutching him fiercely to her bosom.**

&#x200B;

Pretty telling isn't it? Cersei was also crying, with the glorious sight of the tower of the hand burning down.Furthermore, the reference to Rhaenyra hugging her '""last living son""ù, reminds of Maggy the frog prophecy and the implications it will have when Cersei losses her last children.

&#x200B;

# (F)Aegon Theory

# 

When TWOIAF came out, much was speculated about the Blackfyre theory: [see here for instance:](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/121435-faegon-in-twoiaf/)

&#x200B;

Mostly the pretender kings during the Dance of Dragons:

Trystane TrueFyre .Not very subtle here George with the last name:

>Not to be outdone, a hedge knight named Ser **Perkin** the Flea crowned his own **squire Trystane, a stripling of sixteen years,** declaring him to be a **natural son** of the late King Viserys. Any knight can make a knight, and when Ser Perkin began dubbing every sellsword, thief, and butcher's boy who flocked to Trystane's ragged banner, men and boys appeared by the hundreds to pledge themselves to his cause.

A sixteen year old squire. Like (f)Aegon.Bastard of Viserys. The blackfyres are a bastard line.Led by a hedge knight.. JonConnigton is now a landless knight as well, after being exiled by the mad king.

Ser perkin is of course a reference to [Perkin Warbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkin_Warbeck), a pretender of the British crown who claimed to be one of the '""princess of the tower""ù who inspire the story of Prince Aegon.Whats new in Fire&blood is the relationship between Ser Perkin and Larys (who is obviously a parallel to Varys the spider)

>King Aegon's master of whisperers, Larys Strong the Clubfoot, fared much better. The Lord of Harrenhal emerged intact from wherever he had been hiding. Like a man risen from the grave, he came striding through the halls of the Red Keep as if he had never left them, **to be greeted warmly by Ser Perkin the Flea and take a place of honor at the side of his new '""king.""ù**  
>  
>(""¶)  
>  
>Atop Aegon's High Hill, the squire now calling himself King Trystane Truefyre stood on the battlements with Larys Strong and Ser Perkin the Flea, gazing at the swelling ranks of stormlanders. '""We do not have the strength to oppose such a host, sire,""ù Lord Larys told the boy, **'""but perhaps words can succeed where swords must fail. Send me to parley with them.""ù And so the Clubfoot was dispatched across the river under a flag of truce,** accompanied by Grand Maester Orwyle and the Dowager Queen Alicent.(""¶)  
>  
>**The Clubfoot promised that Ser Perkin** and his gutter knights would join the stormlanders in restoring King Aegon II to the Iron Throne, on the condition that all of them save the pretender Trystane would be pardoned for any and all offenses, including high treason, rebellion, robbery, murder, and rape.  
>  
>(""¶)  
>  
>Lord Velaryon did not attempt to deny his guilt. '""What I did, I did for the good of the realm,""ù the old man said. '""I would do the same again. The madness had to end.""ù Lord Strong proved less forthcoming. Grand Maester Orwyle had testified that he gave the poison to his lordship, and **Ser Perkin the Flea swore that he had been the Clubfoot's man, acting entirely on his orders, but Lord Larys would neither confirm nor deny the accusations.**

Anyways, its clear now with F&B that this Trystane blackfyre, I mean Truefyre was propped up by Varys, I mean Larys Strong.

The Other Pretender king that foreshadows (f)Aegon is **Gae**m**on** Palehair.

A son of a whore (like Serra) and a Lyseni (also as Serra):.

>Lady Esselyn during her son's brief reign, confessed under torture that Gaemon's father was not the king, as she had previously claimed, but rather a silver-haired oarsman off a trading galley from Lys.

&#x200B;

Furthermore Sylvenna Sand, the paramour of his mother, could be a hint of the future alliance between aegon and Dorne:

>At the other end of the Street of the Sisters, Gaemon Palehair's queer kingdom blossomed atop Visenya's Hill. The court of this four-year-old bastard king was made up of whores, mummers, and thieves, whilst gangs of ruffians, sellswords, and drunkards defended his '""rule.""ù One decree after another came down from the House of Kisses where the child king had his seat, each more outrageous than the last. Gaemon decreed that girls should henceforth be equal with boys in matter of inheritance, that the poor be given bread and beer in times of famine, that men who had lost limbs in war must afterward be fed and housed by whichever lord they had been fighting for when the loss took place. Gaemon decreed that husbands who beat their wives should themselves be beaten, irrespective of what the wives had done to warrant such chastisement. **These edicts were almost certainly the work of a Dornish whore named Sylvenna Sand, reputedly the paramour of the little king's mother Essie, if Mushroom is to be believed**.

Gaemon was spared, and become Aegon III food taster, which reminds of [Lambert Simnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_Simnel) another pretender to the British crown, claiming (like perkin warbeck) to be one of the princess of the tower that inspire Aegon¬¥s story. Lambert was also spared and put to work in the **royal kitchens**.

(f)Aegon Theory takes me to Serra Mopatis:

# Lemore = Serra theory:

Back in Twoiaf, there was something curious about the daughters of Jaehaerys:

&#x200B;

One was called, ViS\*\*ERRA,\*\*Maegalle died of **Greyscale**, like serra mopatis.

And **Saera** was a whore in Lys.

Now we know much and more about Saera.

>That was not a path that Saera Targaryen cared to walk, however. The princess endured the silence, the cold baths, the scratchy roughspun robes, the meatless meals. She submitted to having her head shaved and being scrubbed with horsehair brushes, and when she was disobedient, she submitted to the cane as well. All this she suffered, for a year and a half""¶but when her chance came, in 85 AC, she seized it\*\*, fleeing from the motherhouse in the dead of night\*\* and making her way down to the docks. When an older sister came upon her during her escape, she knocked the woman down a flight of steps and leapt over her to the door.  
>  
>When word of her flight reached King's Landing, it was assumed that Saera would be hiding somewhere in Oldtown, but Lord Hightower's men combed the city door to door, and no trace was found of her  
>  
>(""¶)  
>  
>The truth did not come out until a year later, **when the former princess was seen in a Lysene pleasure garden, still clad as a novice**. Queen Alysanne wept to hear it. **'""They have made our daughter into a whore,""ù** she said. '""She always was,""ù the king replied.  
>  
>(""¶.)  
>  
>Though Jaehaerys had forbidden it, Alysanne had defied his edict and secretly engaged agents to keep watch over her wayward child across the narrow sea. Saera was still in Lys, she knew from their reports, still at the pleasure garden. Now twenty years of age, **she oft entertained her admirers still garbed as a novice of the Faith; there were evidently a good many Lyseni who took pleasure in ravishing innocent young women who had taken vows of chastity, even when the innocence was feigned.**

A Whore in Lys, that dresses like a novice of the faith""¶Lemore =Serra.

There is more... some of the sons of Saera claimed the Iron throne during the Great Council:

>No fewer than fourteen claims were duly examined and considered by the lords assembled. From Essos came three rival competitors, grandsons of King Jaehaerys through his daughter Saera, each sired by a different father. One was said to be the very image of his grandsire in his youth. **Another, a bastard born to a triarch of Old Volantis, arrived with bags of gold and a dwarf elephant.** The lavish gifts he distributed amongst the poorer lords undoubtedly helped his claim. The elephant proved less useful.

There are no triarch in Pentos, but they are magisters. Gold and Elephants reminds of the Golden Company.

# Samwell Tarly Euronslayer:

[u/Mithras\_Stoneborn](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mithras_Stoneborn)¬¥s  theory   claims that Sam will use his improved archery skills to kill Euron greyjoy with an arrow to the eye.There is a Samwell in F&B that could serve as foreshadowing for this. Or at least about the role of Sams archery skills:

>When the Brackens gathered a strong force to strike back, Lord Samwell Blackwood surprised them on the march, taking them unawares as they camped beneath a riverside mill. In the fight that followed, the mill was put to the torch, and men fought and died for hours bathed in the red light of the flames. Ser Amos Bracken, leading the host from Stone Hedge, cut down and slew Lord Blackwood in single combat, only to perish himself **when a weirwood arrow found the eye slit of his helm and drove deep into his skull**. Supposedly that **shaft was loosed by Lord Samwell's sixteen-year-old sister, Alysanne**, who would later be known as Black Aly, but whether this is fact or mere family legend cannot be known.

# Daenaerys:

This one is puzzling. George changed the order, and some of the names of Jaehaerys childen. In some cases the reason can be to have a more compelling family dynamic, but with daenerys he actually retconed what we knew in the main series about house targaryen.There should have been only one other Daenerys targaryen. Yet here he invented a new one.The only important thing about her is that she died of the Shivers.. a plague that came in a very harsh winter.

Will dany die the same way, shivering during the long night 2.0?

  


# ETA: Faceless Men = Iron bank of Braavos Theory:

 its interesting how the team up to bring down the Rogare bank.

>Even as the fighting in the Vale of Arryn continued, the promise  of the Lysene Spring suffered another grievous blow hundreds of leagues to the  south, with the near-simultaneous demise of Lysandro the Magnificent in Lys and  his brother Drazenko in Sunspear. Though the narrow sea lay between them, the  two Rogares died within a day of each other, both under suspicious  circumstances. Drazenko perished first, choking to death upon a piece of bacon.  Lysandro drowned when his opulent barge sank whilst carrying him from his  Perfumed Garden back to his palace. Though a few would insist that their deaths  were unfortunate accidents, many more took the manner and timing of their  passings as proof of a plot to bring down House Rogare. The Faceless Men of  Braavos were widely believed to have been responsible for the killings; no more  subtle assassins were known to exist anywhere in the wide world. But if indeed the Faceless Men had done these deeds, at whose  bidding had they acted? The Iron Bank of Braavos was suspected,

>(...)

>It was a fool's scheme, and it was quickly undone. Legend claims it was men in  the hire of the Iron Bank of Braavos who first began suggesting that the Rogare  Bank might be unsound, but regardless of who started it, such talk was soon  heard all over Lys.

"Re-reading ASOIAF and looking through this sub made me realise how many plausible theories there are.

" 

Re-reading the ASOIAF series. While reading AGOT, I came across this paragraph. Syrio Forell has just been killed by Ser Meryn Trant, and Arya is on the run:

""She had to leave *now,* she told herself, but when the moment came she was too frightened to move.

*Calm as still water,* a small voice whispered in her ear. Arya was so startled she almost dropped her bundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but her, and the horses, and the dead men.

*Quiet as a shadow,* she heard. Was it her own voice, or Syrio's? She could not tell, yet somehow it calmed her fears.""

It's clearly not just an inner voice, as she is actually startled and starts looking around for someone who could have spoken.

This stood out to me and I immediately thought about the Tower of Joy scene where younger Ned hears Bran call out to him and turns around. Could it be his voice that she hears? Could he have looked back and seen that she needed courage in that moment? If not, where else did the voice come from? Just curious to hear some thoughts on the matter:)",SPOILER
"I don't think I have ever seen a post about this subject, but I am relatively new to Reddit so I might have missed it

There is a single character who inspires per capita the most derision in all of ASOIAF and who deserves none of it. I am of course talking about the handsome, the noble, the brave, the intelligent, the heroic Waymar Royce.

Waymar Royce is of the first men. His eldest brother is Heir to Runestone, leaving him and middle brother Robar to make their own fortunes. And while his brother travels as a glorified hedge Knight, losing tourneys and collecting Kings, Waymar chooses to serve in the Nights Watch, a sacrifice he fully understands but a noble calling for houses such as his. Waymar earns his place as a sworn brother, proving his skill at arms to become a ranger. 

On his very first ranging, he goes above and beyond to ensure he succeeds at his mission. Despite the cold a man like Waymar would not stay in the home of a creature like craster. Although new to the north he proves his intellect. And when he comes face to face with a creature that for the last thousand years has only appeared in bedtime stories and nightmares, he delivers some of the most badass words ever uttered in his universe, does not risk his men's lives by calling for help, and fights to the death.

Some of you will foolishly point out waymar arrogance. And yes he did have an ego. He demanded to lead his first ranging. and yet he proves himself the best man for the job. He speaks down to his subordinates. Yet proves himself the leader. If benjen Stark, Quorin Halfhand, or Jeremy Rykker led that ill fatted ranging they would have died the same way.

Let us all raise a glass in admiration for a true son of the first men and a true man of the night's watch.",SPOILER

He's had a decent amount of chapters and George has given him one of the best written and most compelling arcs in the series. Theon is right there amongst Bran, Robb, Jon, Ned, and the direwolves in the very first chapter of the series. George has even gone on record saying that the character of Ramsay Bolton was written specifically FOR Theon and his character arc. On top of this, the show has kept him around right up to the final season, even though he's certainly not one of the '""fan favorites""ù. Back when the show was still in early development (and George was still heavily involved), Alfie Allen was one of the first actors confirmed in the casting process along with the Stark children. The Greyjoy family itself also sees a massive spike in page time starting with A Feast for Crows. What I'm getting at with all this is, what is everyone's favorite Turncloak's role in the story? It's easy to deduce Jon, Dany, Tyrion, and the Starks' endgames in the story as being the heroes and what not, but I can't for the life of me predict where Theon's story is headed.

Did Jaime truly compel Varys at sword point to free Tyrion, or was Varys already planning on freeing him and sending him to join Dany?

"It's known that Aegon the Unwothy is a parallel to Robert.  They are both ineffective kings who give in to their vices, though Aegon the Unworthy is much crueler than Robert was.  However, a parallel between the two that I just figured  out the ""love"" triangle that both men are a part of.  

&#x200B;

Aegon the Unworthy's is unhappily married to Naerys who, according to song, was in love with her bother, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight who was part of the Kngsgaurd.  That rumor lead to Naerys' son Daeron being thought of being illegitimate and led to another with an equal claim (because if a bastard is sitting the throne, than why not a better suited bastard) to rise in rebellion.  

&#x200B;

It's nearly identical to what happened with Robert.  He also has an unhappy marriage to Cersei who really is sleeping with her brother who like Aemon the Dragonknight, is part of the Kingsgaurd.  Their union really did lead to illegitimate children sitting the throne and when others found out about the illegitimacy of the supposed Baratheon children, they rose up against them.  

&#x200B;

These are the ideas that popped into my head when I realized this.  None of them are really fleshed out or anything but I needed to get them out:

*  Life is not a song
   * The world views the ""romance"" of Queen Naerys and Aemon the Dragon Knight as something pure and romantic but if they really did have romantic feelings for each other, it probably wasn't as pure as the songs make it out to be.
   * Of course, this rumor did not just create a song, but it really did effect real life. With this rumor, came the idea that Daeron was not the actual heir to the throne.  While I believe this rumor to be false, it was the a taste of what would happen if such a romance was to take place in real life.  This rumor was the basis for doubt in Daeron II legitimacy for the throne and lead to rebellion.  
   * The vibe I get from the Cersei chapters in AFFC, is that she was very much the young girl that Sansa was in the beginning of the story.  She loved the songs and believed her own pending betrothal to Rhaegar would be her song come to life.  When that doesn't pan out, she affixes herself to Jaime and to an extent, she is living a song, though song translated into life is a twisted and bloody thing. 
* Clue to what will come to pass
   * This song of Aemon the Dragon Knight and Queen Naerys must have loomed large in Cersei's mind because of the outcome of the story had in history, that being rebellion.  By how much that story is repeated in the books, it was a very popular story.  
   * Could it have been a clue to us? That song has been in the story since beginning and we do get small glimpses of what that particular story can mean in this context.  This could have been a clue to us of what would happen should the secret come out.  War and rebellion and one that would have lasting effects for a very long time.  That being this quote from AGOT Jon VIII :

> The old man touched the maester's chain that hung loosely around his thin, fleshless neck. ""My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead. My grandfather named me for Prince **Aemon** the **Dragonknight**, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe.

"I've been thinking about this expression.

"This might have been mentioned somewhere before but I haven't seen it, so I apologise if I'm stepping on someone's toes here. However it's just occurred to me Cersei may be a bit crazy because she's a result of an incestuous marriage.

There's a scene in the show, and I think it's in the books, where Cersei and Tyrion talk about her kids and how Jofferey is insane because Cersei and Jaime are brother and sister. In the scene (which is one of my favourite Cersei scenes) she mentions a saying that goes along the lines of ""when a targaryen was born the gods flipped a coin"". Tyrion replies by saying she beat the odds because only of of her kids was mad.

But what if the odds are actually closer to one in three? 

We know Jofferey is mad, he's a one in three.

We know Viserys is mad, he's a one in three. 

The argument could be made for Visenya, Aegon I sister being a bit tapped in the head too. 

Now there are clearly notable exceptions. But if we treat the Targaryen lineage as a whole up until Aerys II, there aren't too many who are categorically crazy, certainly not half of the entire dynasty. This makes me think the one in two scenario was a bit exaggerated. 

Now bringing this all back round to Cersei, she's one child of the three that Tywin and Joanna had together (if we don't take into account that Cersei and Jaime may be the mad King's bastards), and Tywin and Joanna were first cousins. For all their flaws I don't think anyone would call Jaime or Tyrion mad. 

So is it possible Cersei's nature is down to not only her pretty miserable life in Kings Landing, but also this ""rule of three"" brought about by a fairly incestuous marriage? 
",SPOILER
"GRRM confirmed that Jeyne Westerling will be in the Prologue of TWoW but she won't be the POV. Before attempting to guess what might happen in this chapter, it is a good idea to get down to the basics.

First of all, we need to address the question of why we need this Prologue. Above else, there are two answers that matters most:

1. because there will be some interesting story happening in the Prologue

1. because this part of the story is very late in the schedule and we need to see what happens here right away before we can move on with the rest of the story

The first reason is very straightforward but worth elaborating. If everything goes as planned, there won't be an interesting story to see. Specifically, if the column will reach Casterly Rock without any problem on the road, there is no need to have a Prologue showing this travel. In addition to that, I can't see any reason to have a Prologue at Casterly Rock at this point of the story. 

For example, imagine how the story can move forward if the hostages are brought to Casterly Rock without any problem and we have the Prologue there with Jeyne in the scene. They can't have anything to do with the ironborn or more distant parts of the story. They might soon learn the King's Landing events like Cersei's imprisonment and the deaths of Kevan and Pycelle. But who are they? Which characters at Casterly Rock might have anything to do with these events? What can they do and how do these things matter? Remember, the Prologues set up something so that the story can add to it by moving on.

One might somehow connect the Prologue at Casterly Rock with the Riverlands stuff but still, there are a lot of unknowns there. Will the hostages escape and return to Riverlands? Then, what was the point of giving them a safe travel? With low tier or unknown characters and no obvious ways to connect with other parts of the story, the reason for having the Prologue at Casterly Rock seems weak.

Returning to the basic question, why do we need to have this Prologue with Jeyne? Because there will be an interesting and unexpected development in the Prologue and the most straightforward way this can unravel is that the column will not reach Casterly Rock as planned. There will be a rescue attempt on the way and all hell will break loose.

This brings us to the second reason. The travel to Casterly Rock from Riverrun started in Jaime VII of AFfC. After they departed, Jaime spent 6-7 days at Riverrun as directly stated in the text and also '""more days passed""ù in this chapter until he got Cersei's letter. As a result, the last we saw Jaime in AFfC, Forley Prester and his column were at least 10 days into their journey to Casterly Rock. And it started snowing in Riverlands right at this moment. Then Jaime traveled to Raventree Hall for an unknown time and dealt with Lord Tytos. That night he came to Pennytree, reunited with Brienne and disappeared. Then we have Cersei 1 of ADwD where Kevan visits Cersei in the jail and tells him that Jaime disappeared. Then Cersei 2 happens with the walk of shame. Finally we have the Epilogue where they still have no news from Jaime. Moreover, there is no news about Forley Prester and the hostages in the Epilogue. From the moment Forley Prester started the journey to Casterly Rock to the Epilogue of ADwD, a lot of time has passed, at least a month, maybe close to two months. 

This should tell you how late the Prologue stuff is compared to the rest of the story and why we need to see it as first thing in TWoW.

If nothing unexpected happened and Forley Prester was at Casterly Rock, Kevan could have got a raven from them and mentioned it in the Epilogue. Then I think the column has not arrived to Casterly Rock yet. To explain such a huge delay in a journey from Riverrun to Casterly Rock, we should delve into geography and travel times.

The column is taking the River Road. At the passing between the Westerlands and the Riverlands, the River Road elevates to hills and highlands. Golden Tooth is a strong castle that guards this passage in the hills. Robb was able to bypass the Golden Tooth by a goat track in the hills. He defeated the Lannister army at the Battle of Oxcross thanks to this path.

From Lannisport to Oxcross, it is three days of hard ride. I am guessing that from Riverrun to Golden Tooth, it should take at least 6 days of hard ride. That is because the distance is about twice as long and the road gets steeper once it comes close to Golden Tooth.

For a column of hundreds of people with carts and whatnot, the travel should take 5-10 times longer than a hard ride. Besides, Forley Prester is taking it very safely and he would not jeopardize the travel by forcing unnecessary speed. More importantly, if it started snowing in Riverlands proper, then it should be snowing much heavier up in the highlands where the River Road takes them to Golden Tooth. This snow can easily explain much of the delay. Golden Tooth might have become impassable. Another thing to keep in mind is that Blackfish (who participated in the Battle of Oxcross) remembers Robb's goat track and still there might be others among the BwB. As a result, they might plan the rescue at Westerlands after by-passing the Golden Tooth through this goat track. Once there, the guards of Forley Prester might be expected to be lower now that he is in his home country with the only road at his back guarded by a strong castle.

###Conclusion

The Prologue will take place in Westerlands somewhere close to Oxcross. Snowfall and other possible reasons in the Prologue will explain the huge delay. The rescuers will arrive by the goat track of Grey Wind. This rescue operation will naturally be connected to the immediate Jaime/Brienne chapters which are also late in the schedule. From there, TWoW proper will finally be able to start.",SPOILER

But in GoT the sigil is described by Bran to maester Luwin as a crowned stag, now that Robert's king. I'm pretty sure it's that way in the main books as well, the stag of Baratheon only getting its crown after Robert became king.

But AKOTSK takes place almost a century before Asoiaf, well before any Baratheons were kings. They were never even Storm Kings, their house was founded with the rise of the Targaryens.

"Specifically this part -    

>""He had laughing green eyes, but when he laughed, his eyes did not"".   

^ This can be interpreted a multitude of ways, but pretty much any of them generally indicate something that is off about him. It's not a good thing.  

- He's an unfeeling creep, keeping up a facade of friendliness and cordiality. A sociopath that can put on a good show.   

- Eyes are the gateway to the soul. His laughter (words) not matching his gaze (body language) indicates an individual with ulterior, sinister, motives.     

The bit about his breath always smelling of fresh mint leaves is something i doubt GRRM merely wrote as a hobby/snack Littlefinger enjoys, although I'm sure he does enjoy it.    

Mint is associated with fresh cleanliness. 

But Littlefinger constantly spews poison into the ears of those he ""serves"". He can be over flattering and accomodating (to Big Boy Bobby B) and instill fear into others' minds to goad them into relying on his protection and assurances (Sansa).

Jon has a dream of himself raging and killing people he cares about (i imagine in a fit of anger but it's not super clear), he is then mentioned shouting out his claims of being the Lord of Winterfell. Does anyone think this could be alluding to his mindset post resurrection?

"The serpentine steps in the Red Keep are one of the deadliest things in Fire & Blood.

Thereafter she walked with a cane.

They killed Grand Maester Mellos:

Mellos collapsed one night whilst he was climbing the serpentine steps**.

Queen Alicent was captured on them while two of her guards were slain:

> **Queen Alicent was arrested on the serpentine steps** as she made her
way back to her chambers. Her captors wore the seahorse of House
Velaryon upon their doublets, and though they **slew the two men
guarding her**, they did no harm to the Dowager Queen herself, nor to
her ladies. The Queen in Chains was chained again and taken to the
dungeons, there to await the pleasure of the new king.

They murdered the great Corlys Velaryon:

> For all these reasons, the realm suffered a terrible blow on the sixth
day of the third moon of 132 AC, when **Corlys Velaryon, Lord of the
Tides, collapsed whilst ascending the serpentine steps** in the Red Keep
of King's Landing. By the time Grand Maester Munkun came rushing
to his aid, **the Sea Snake was dead**.

And they broke little Falena Stokeworth's leg:

> Pretty Falena Stokeworth, a vivacious girl of eight who had sometimes
played at dolls with the little queen, **took a tumble down the serpentine
steps and broke her leg**

In the main series, Sansa had a close call on them:

> She was racing headlong down the serpentine steps when a man lurched out of a hidden doorway. **Sansa caromed into him and lost her balance. Iron fingers caught her by the wrist before she could fall, and a deep voice rasped at her. ""It's a long roll down the serpentine, little bird. Want to kill us both?""** His laughter was rough as a saw on stone. ""Maybe you do."" (Sansa II, ACOK)

People were killed on them during the Sack of King's Landing:

> ""The castle is ours, ser, and the city,"" Roland Crakehall told him, which was half true. **Targaryen loyalists were still dying on the serpentine steps** and in the armory, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch were scaling the walls of Maegor's Holdfast, and Ned Stark was leading his northmen through the King's Gate even then, but Crakehall could not have known that. (Jaime II, ASOS)

And, worst of all, Dontos barfed on them:

> The bells were ringing out across the city, more and more of them joining in. She kept her head down and stayed in the shadows, close behind Dontos. **While descending the serpentine steps he stumbled to his knees and retched**. My poor Florian, she thought, as he wiped his mouth with a floppy sleeve. (Sansa V, ASOS)

I would recommend avoiding those snaky steps whenever possible. They have a bad history.

Honorable mention to this flight of stairs in the Starry Sept of Oldtown:

> None of this was known on Westeros at the time, however, and soon
enough King Jaehaerys had a fresh concern. In the Starry Sept of
Oldtown, **the High Septon had collapsed whilst ascending a flight of
steps to his bedchamber. He was dead before he reached the bottom**.

My guess is that Alliser Thorne becomes Lord Commander in the aftermath of Jon's death, and Jon kills him and disbands the Watch after coming back to life.

Jorah would re-form the Watch during the Long Night, take the black as per his father's dying wishes, and become the 1000th and last Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

"###The Blue Eyed King

> '""Well and good,""ù announced Pycelle. '""Let Stannis rot in Lys, I say. We are well rid of the man and his ambitions.""ù

> '""Did you turn into an utter fool when Tyrion shaved your beard? This is _Stannis Baratheon_. __The man will fight to the bitter end and then some__. If he is gone, it can only mean he intends to resume the war.

* As foreshadowed in the House of the Undying, Stannis and Dany will fight. I expect this conflict to be a naval battle because of the introduction of the Manderly Fleet and the mission of Davos. During this naval battle, Davos will fire an iron bolt that will slay Viserion like the legendary [Davos the Dragonslayer](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Davos_the_Dragonslayer). However, Dany will have two more dragons which will own the day and Stannis will be defeated, hence slaying the lie that Stannis is Azor Ahai Reborn.

* Stannis is a character driven by ambition and resentment. It is mistaken to take Stannis as heroic. It is grossly mistaken to believe that Stannis will burn Shireen in a heroic but desperate attempt to save the world. The story of Stannis is a classical Faustian bargain. He sold his soul to the devil and is going downhill to his doom. There is thematic foreshadowing for the Breaking Bad of Stannis by another character that is also Breaking Bad.

'""Give me the cup,""ù he told the Stranger, '""for I shall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion's blood, so much the better. __As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love.__""ù

###The Night's King Reborn

* After the defeat against Dany, Stannis will retreat to Winterfell where the Northmen will abandon him. Stannis will then retire to Nightfort. Stannis will desire to punish all those pretenders and traitors who defied and abandoned him. With the sacrifice of Shireen, Mel will succeed in giving Stannis a shadow dragon with an icy breath. The sacrifice of Shireen at Nightfort and the birth of the shadow dragon will break the Wall, which I like to see in the Epilogue of TWoW. 

> A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and __when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well__.

> ""¶

> '""I know the cost! Last night, gazing into that hearth, I saw things in the flames as well. I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows, burning . . . burning, Davos. __His own crown consumed his flesh and turned him into ash__. Do you think I need Melisandre to tell me what that means? Or you?""ù The king moved, so __his shadow fell upon King's Landing__.

###Foreshadowing for the Shadow Dragon

> '""Shadows only live when given birth by light, and the king's fires burn so low I dare not draw off any more to make another son. It might well kill him.""ù Melisandre moved closer. '""With another man, though . . . a man whose flames still burn hot and high . . . if you truly wish to serve your king's cause, come to my chamber one night.

> Jon glanced over his shoulder. The shadow was there, just as she had said, etched in moonlight against the Wall.

###The Bitter End and Then Some

* Having sacrificed the last piece of his soul left, Stannis will now ride his dragon with Mel at his back, both as thralls to the Others. The rest is the stuff of ADoS.

* Stannis and the shadow dragon fueled by Shireen's soul will be defeated by one of Dany's dragons over King's Landing or the Gods Eye; hence fulfilling the vision of Stannis about his crown turning him into ash and the prophetic dreams of Shireen about dragons coming to eat her. This will be a dragon duel between Stannis and Tyrion, with many parallels to another historical dragon duel between Aemond and Daemon. 

> Stannis helped his woman down from the dragon's back, then turned to face his opponent. '""Imp, I hear you have been seeking us.""ù

> '""Only you,""ù Tyrion replied. '""Who told you where to find me?""ù

> '""My lady,""ù Stannis answered. '""She sees much and more, my Melisandre. You were a fool to come alone.""ù

> '""Were I not alone, you would not have come,""ù said Tyrion.

> '""Yet you are, and here I am. You have lived too long, imp.""ù

> '""On that much we agree,""ù Tyrion replied.

* Aemond 

1. wore Baratheon colors (clad in night-black armor chased with gold)

1. put a sapphire in place of his missing eye

1. was a Kinslayer 

1. bewitched by Alys Rivers, who saw things in fires.

"Aegon conquered Westeros with the help of his two sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys, both of whom played a pivotal role in the Conquest. Aegon wouldn't have been Lord of the Seven Kingdoms without his sister-wives, so he owed them a major debt of gratitude. However, upon Aegon's death, it was Aegon's son Aenys who ascended to the throne, when Visenya was still alive. 

&#x200B;

Visenya is my heroine, a warrior-queen who survived and thrived on male-dominated battlefield. She brought one city after another to its knees. She single-handedly conquered the Vale of Arryn without bloodshed. 

&#x200B;

The rule of succession was really unfair to Visenya. Being the eldest of the three siblings, she could not succeed their father only because she was female, though she was Aegon's equal in every major way. And then upon Aegon's death, she had to watch Aenys crowned King and bend her knees to him. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, upon conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, Aegon should have changed the rule of succession to recognize the contribution of Visenya and Rhaenys in the Conquest. He should have named Visenya his heir and Rhaenys (if she was not killed) heir to Visenya, and Aegon's first born child (whoever his or her mother was) heir after his two sister-wives. 

&#x200B;

Visenya and Rhaenys (if not killed) were both capable of and deserved to be ruling Queen in their own right. They should really have preceded their sons in the line of succession because their sons really did nothing in the Conquest and were unfit to rule (Aenys too weak, Maegor too cruel). 

&#x200B;

What do you think? Do you think Visenya should have been heir to Aegon's throne?

"**Ajorahai and Daenissa** 

One of the most long running speculations among the fandom is Jorah being a figurative Azor Ahai. Many thought it would be Dany but that may be too literal for some fans for GRRM also may imply not being to be literal with his prophecies and their interpretation. Jorah's inferred position as AA makes more sense on how GRRM wants us to really grasp his true intention. When reading the legend, I began to question if GRRM was really speaking about a literal magic sword. Than I researched meanings having double entendres such as a dance = fight or sword could mean baby. Yet, a sword could also mean a man's genitals and so on. 

Now I also strongly believe in the theory of 2 Nissa Nissas. The name alone spells 2 separate women as this role. The story starts off with Ice and Fire (Lyanna and Rheagar). Ice being female and fire being male. Rheagar is Azor Ahai with his flesh sword penetrating Lyanna AKA 1st Nissa (Nyssa means '""beginning"" in Greek and ""end"" in Latin) resulting in her death by birthing Jon (Aegon) being born = lightbringer (AKA Death to old feudal system along with Arya). This union resulted in the disturbance of the white walkers for they foresaw the future and had to stop the end of it. The Nissa Nissa part proves there should be two separate characters that are labeled under Nissa. 

The story will end with Fire and ice (Daenerys and Jorah). Ice being male this time and fire being female. Jorah is Azor Ahai (Ajorahai) and Daenerys is the second Nissa (The end) for she will Bear a living child that will help defeat the night king. Dany will survive this time with her child by Jorah. It will end with the second Nissa living. 

The two moons in the sky may not be two physical moons that existed there. But it could be one actually in the sky and the other in the water as it's reflection. For Dany sees the moon in the water as she bathes in the lake of womb of world. This could be her connection to it. Then Tyrion says this:

Only the brightest stars were visible, all to the west. A dull red glow lit the sky to the northeast, the color of a blood bruise. Tyrion had never seen¬†a bigger moon. Monstrous, swollen,¬†it looked as if it had¬†swallowed the sun and woken with a fever.¬†Its twin, floating on the sea beyond the ship, shimmered red with every wave.¬†(ADWD, Tyrion)

So if rises in the east and sets in the west always then definitely in the water it looks like it rises in the west and sets in the east. But the water has everything backwards. The water can be a deceiver but it can also bring life. Shades of grey upon it. Grey waters are something in the story. So the 1st moon in the sky is Lyanna and the sky signals death for many go to the night lands in the sky after death. Dany is the second moon in the water which signals life to bring about spring. Lyanna was the first moon and Dany is her reflection in the water (the second moon). But what happens when you see your reflection in the mirror, you look opposite yourself. GRRM might have explored this by making the moon reflect fire and ice. The first moon was ice (Lyanna) and the second was now fire (Dany) They both create water babies, Lyanna with the cost of her life to bring in death (Jon death to winter) and Dany with the cost of her barrenness (death) to bring in life (Spring).

**AGoT:**

**Dany 1**

They're meeting with Drogo is different in book thann show. Jorah is not a blood rider in show he is just there at the wedding. Maybe the show wanted to make him look special somehow and have him only say to Dany blood of my blood in 1x10. For in the books, all of Dany's blood riders say to her '""blood of my blood.""ù Anyway, Jorah has the blood of dragon by saying the oath. 

**CoK** 

**Dany 1**

Jorah tells Dany about his first two wives. He did tempered his manhood in his first wife but no dice too. Now Lynesse was a lion""¶a lioness""¶or should I say Lyonesse""¶so maybe Jorah captured a lion and plunged his manhood into her yet she also could not produce the child of spring. The third time will be Dany for sure and produce the child of spring.

**Dany 3**

Dany snaps at Jorah for first time for calling her a child than she becomes obsessed with Dragons. This is Dany telling Jorah to see her as a woman and not a child. A woman of childbearing age that could give him a baby. 

Could this be red god calling to Dany and birth her eggs: 

'""Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch her dragon's eggs across the tent.""ù

Daenerys the bride of fire and Jorah her husband of ice. 

Dragons come from the east and then go west where they died. Magic had also died with them:

'""Magic had died in the west""ù

Now the are back in the story and magic comes back too.

Then Dan talks with Irri about them and Irri says: 

Just to reiterate about the moon=eggs and such. This has also to do with the two AAs and NNs. For there were 2 moons so I believe there were also two suns. It is known. 

**Dany 4**

Jorah says to Dany blood of my blood. Meaning they share blood, making him an indirect Targ. For they share one life and if she dies he dies with her. Prophecy can be a dangerous thing when taken to literally which Mel does. She thinks she brought ice and fire together because she thinks Jon is so she sees him as illegitimate when he isn't he is actually water. (I&F, AJ&DN?)

**Dany 7**

Maegi sounds like red priestess:

'""maegi was a woman who lay with demons and practiced the blackest of sorceries, a vile thing, evil and soulless, who came to men in the dark of night and sucked life and strength from their bodies.""ù

Jorah points out how Mirri learned this: 

'""Jorah Mormont spoke up. ""A maester?""

""Marwyn, he named himself,"" the woman replied in the Common Tongue. ""From the sea. Beyond the sea. The Seven Lands, he said. Sunset Lands. Where men are iron and dragons rule. He taught me this speech.""

Yet how can dragons rule in a land where they are now dead. 

Sunset lands - could this be where dragons will die but give birth to dragon people instead?

This could foreshadow Jorah needing healing from something that makes his hair fall off and revealing smooth skin for dany. Marwyn and Sam could both heal him. In the show Jorah got greyscale to fulfill this if the books goes there somehow too. This could uncover Jorah's inner beauty in a more organic way. 

This could be AA showing more of his love for Dany by getting better/skinned for her and loving her best of all.

**Dany 8**

Sun is hurt as imagery to equal death?:

'""the sun was low on the horizon, the sky a bruised""ù

In the show, Jorah not insult by Dany, but in book calls her a fool. She would have been safe with him if they'd gone to Asshai together. This could be Jorah trying to speed up the process and putting a baby in Dany knowing somehow her baby would die?

**Dany 9**

Dany has these fever dreams, becoming very important I think. It's what made her begin the mother of dragons process. Kept repeating: don't want to wake dragon do you? Eventually leading Jorah to slay the dragon inside the princess by giving her a real human baby. 

**Dany 10**

She has no bride gift to give him but she promises this: 

and turned to the last of her champions. ""Ser Jorah Mormont,"" she said, ""first and greatest of my knights, I have no bride gift to give you, but I swear to you, one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen, dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel. And I would ask for your oath as well.""ù

Swords = babies

So AA put a sword (manhood) in NN and made a sword (baby).

Whole breakdown:

The long sword could be his manhood 

Dragon forged = in her 

Valyrian steel = the baby. 

From my hands = from body? (EG,AJ&DN)

**CoK**

**Dany 3**

Food for thought: Also Dan is starting to think she may use her body to get what she wanted even though she doesn't yet. Could this signal her and Daario's relationship being purely to keep him in line. Physical and nothing more. The show made that very clear from the get go actually that Daario never really mattered to Dany. She seems to use Jor rightfully so for his strong arms""¶hint hint!

Food for thought: It seems Quaithe now approaches Dany and tells her she is the reason why there is magic in world again. She touches her wrist and then it tingles. Does this mean once Dany loses her dragons and she becomes ordinary, magic will definitely be no more important in the realms of men to fight the others especially. GRRM could say Dan is just an ordinary person and what makes her great is dragons but nothing more. This could explain that weird scene with the shows version of Mero. He seemed to be not impressed with Dany's looks which is the reason why he compared her to a regular prostitute in Lys. As in you would be whatever if it wasn't for your dragons. Explains why she isn't counted as beautiful until her dragons are born. But to Jorah she is not ordinary, she matters that is why he gives her strength. He's the only one in the story that cares for Dany as a woman instead of as the mother of dragons. Yet, she is blind to her own power at this point which means the dragons may have to be slain including her internal drag.

**SoS**

**Dany 1**

What could have changed Rhaegar after spending so much time reading to finally want to fight and be knighted. Could it have something to do with prophecies that he thought he had to prepare for? Jorah seems to be going through that which is of course more evident on the show since it is farther along in the story. 

Also Dany is like Rhaegar who loved to read and getting ready for fulfill the Prophecy like the one Melisandre told her about in 7x02. She could be NN though to Jorah's AA.  

**DwD**

**Dany 4**

Opens with dialog between Dan and green grace. Dan says:

""I am no butcher¬†queen.""ù - kind of what she told Da told her she must become too fight the harpies. GG wants Dany to marry Hiz to get peace back. 

GG says this and Dany wants that in a man:

""But there is still much that a strong man might do.""ù

She loves her strong men, which is what she calls Jorah when he comes back to her in the show 7x05. 

The only way Dan knows how and that is dangerous: ¬†

Elsewise, I fear, your reign must end as it began, in blood and fire.""ù

Anything that fulfills a prophecy seems to be doomed as well:

""We are an old people. Ancestors are important to us. Wed Hizdahr zo Loraq and make a son with him, a son whose father is the harpy, whose mother is the dragon. In him the prophecies shall be fulfilled""ù

Could this mean Jon could be her enemy in the end, at least in the books:

'""your enemies will melt¬†away¬†like snow.""ù

**Dany 10**

Imagery for the way she use to live with the Dothraki and maybe the moment Jorsh began to love her:

'""The earth felt warm between her toes.¬†The grass was as tall as she was. It never seemed so high when I was mounted on my silver, riding beside my sun-and-stars at the head of his khalasar. As she walked, she tapped her thigh with the pitmaster's whip. That, and the rags on her back, were all she had taken from Meereen.""ù

In the show Dany is seen riding a long side Jorah more than Drogo. The Khaleesi always rides a long side her Khal. Jorah likes to be by Dany's side a lot and she even says she needs him by her side. I will also speculate on this in my endgame section. 

This is interesting. Here GRRM seems to mixing swords with sex. As if tempering a sword could be a metaphor for sex as Daario was taken hostage by Yunkai and he could be boasting of his relationship with Dany:

'""He takes great pride in his ""¶ his swordsmanship.""ù

More evidence that AA's sword was actually his penis. 

**Jon and Arya**

I always felt they were both meant to be. Efforts taken by GRRM to show they both look alike and mostly the ones to have Stark-like personalities also convinces me. Come to find out also, that Jon and Arya are cousins and not half-siblings. All should be more evidence that they will get married or at least be betrothed to one another by the series end. Their relationship can be summed up into this phrase: '""absence makes the heart grow fonder.""ù The books reflect more their relationship over the show big time. GRRM has made a priority to have people smacked with this relationship through out the story. They are both constantly thinking about each other. Jon when he is with Ygritte. As if he knows that Arya may not actually be his sister. Jon calls her his heart multiple times in text, and we finally get a moment in season 7 when Sansa refers to this by saying Jon's '""heart will probably stop""ù when he sees Arya once again. 

That outline that was leaked a few years ago was a shot in the foot for GRRM. It may not have had the whole story we know now but it had Arya and Jon falling in love. Many people thought it was switched over from Arya to Dany, but GRRM himself has said countless times, he was not going to change the ending that he had in mind in 1991. This outline was written in 1993. So no matter for what time in the story the relationship would be planned, it would have been written in anyway. Arya and Jon were always going to be on the table and Dany is just another red herring (red is a color that is all over her story). By series end Jon will find out about him being rightful heir to the throne, the remaining Starks will capitalize on his position (including Jon himself), and he will legitimize himself as Jon Stark. He may have Targ in him but he doesn't identify with them. Blood is the only tie, but nurture might be stronger than nature in this story. I've been thinking that this could be the betrayal for love in Dany's prophecy. Either realizing she isn't the last Targ or her hoping that Jon would choose to be a Targ and not Stark, but he still chooses Stark anyway. Hard to say.

Furthermore, I've noticed both Arya and Jon = death - for they are associated with the blacksmith which associates with death. Jon because he gets an idea to make Arya a sword and also to make weapons out of dragon glass. (indirect blacksmith because he doesn't physically make the swords himself but orders them to be made) Arya has the hands of a blacksmith, the friendship with a blacksmith Gendry etc""¶This will lead up to them tag teaming against the Night's King and Arya using Catspaw to kill him for her Eowyn like moment. Which means they will both be the ones to kill off the winter. At the same time Daenerys will be giving birth to her child by Jorah signaling that spring is here. 

Now I move on to a very crazy observation I made about Jon Arryn's name. Jon was named after him by Ned. When you look at the name Jon Arryn remove the n from his name and you get Arry - the nick name Arya used to hide out as a boy. Jon Arryn also married one of his cousins. The fact both their Dire wolves are still alive gives me more reason to believe in Arya fated to be queen (Nymeria rules her own pack).  

The show runners knew that Arya and Jon were meant to be but to give the audience a surprise ending anyway they had to downplay or get rid of the connection in certain spots from the book but they kept certain things in like Arya thwarting her plans to kill Cersei for Jon, just like Jon was willing to forget about his vows from the nights watch for her in books. (Dany will get Ygritted, abandon her just the same. He is capable of something like this why wouldn't he do it again.) Jon is all duty to his family like Ned. He is a wolf through and through, not a dragon. 

That's why he will adopt the new sigil to house Stark as blue rose. (where '""the seed is strong""ù comes in) I think it means that even if Jon is Rhaegar's son the Stark seed is strong and Jon took up after his Uncle Ned in looks and personality. Both of them represent death of feudal system and the overused tropes. For the tomboy becomes queen and the thought of bastard becomes king. It also goes along with what Maisie said about Arya having different goals this season. Arya and Gendry was a never will happen. When Arya said they could be family, it's because Gendry will marry Sansa, he does like redheads. Remember when he was checking Melisandre out before she buys him from the Brotherhood Without Banners. 

Which brings me to what I think the meet up at Winterfell will represent. Certain characters will also represent others from the season 1 call back to Robert Baratheon's visit. All of the remaining Starks sans Bran will all represent Ned. Looking at the sneak peak of Sansa from a couple of weeks ago where she says to Dany on arrival '""Winterfell is yours, your grace""ù harkens back to Ned saying that to Robert. Dany I believe may represent both Robert and Cersei coming to winterfell. I loved the shot of Jorah walking by her side. I believe he may represent Jaime in this scenario. Knowing they will eventually go to the next level in their relationship, they could get caught like Cersei and Jaime got caught by Bran. Or Bran could just sneak-a-peak like he always does. Jon = Rhaegar and Ned for they both loved Lyanna in different ways obviously. Arya = Lyanna and Ned. See the pattern here. Sansa = Catelyn and Ned and her old self looking at Joffrey. But this time another Baratheon will be looking at her. You guessed it, Gendry = Robert and Joffrey. The Hound is the hound and Tyrion will go missing again maybe by some developing strategy. 

So to just sum everything up, Dany will ride up to Winterfell and introduce herself. Jon will probably ignore her like Cersei got ignored by Robert when going see Lyanna's tomb when he catches a glimpse of Arya. Sansa will be the first person Jon sees in return. Like season 1, Arya was kind of late getting to the party and the same thing will happen one more time. She will see Jon riding up as she overlooks the road. Nothing has ever made Arya feel more hesitant and nervous than this moment. So she takes her sweet time getting to greet Jon. The moment will be special and have romantic overtones to it hugely. Finally Jon has his heart back with him, and boy does he look shocked on how she has grown with needle at her hip. Jon's heart skips a bit and both he and Arya go down to the crypts together to pay their respects to Ned's tomb and Dany is left behind in shock that Jon sidelined her for his '""little sister.""ù

Hearing all this bickering about Jon won't see Arya differently when he sees her, is just ridiculous. Jon will most definitely accept Arya as a queen and wife. They are the ones that look more like Starks to continue the line. Jon will not allow the Stark line to die especially for his aunt. His love for Arya will grow more, especially when Jon realizes they are cousins. The romance will blossom and go from there. It is known. ",SPOILER
"**Fertility Connection**

In my previous section I have made and pinpointed Jorah's connection to fertile land and vegetation. Fundamentally speaking, GRRM has placed Jorah in places in the narrative where nature grows fervently or even his voice speaks through something nature-like such as grass. Dany's whole overlaying story is about being queen and rightful heir of the iron throne but the underlaying message is her being a mother. In the show it has been foreshadowing that Dany will be become a mother, but I'm still not convinced that Jon will be the father, for reasons I will highlight in a later section. There is still time for Jorah to assume that role of father opposite to Dany's mother. 

**GoT**

**Dany 1**

She only seems to know Westeros by what her bro tells her and she thinks of fertile land and knights... like a myth in a story... and that it's theirs no matter what logic may say

After a few sentences on fertility, later mentioned dany as quickening in mother's womb just like Mirri prophecy to her after she can't have kids. This correlation between Dany in her mother's womb and a weird priestess giving Dany an omen about her barrenness while using the same language of '""quickening""ù I think is very revealing. There is some connection between Willem Darry who saved Dany whilst still a baby and Jorah Mormont. This I feel is a big build up to the end of the book series and a huge bait and switch or season 8. 

**Dany 3**

Opens with Jorah and Dany. The grass part but goes more in depth than show. Show only had ghost grass part: 

and now,"" Ser Jorah agreed. ""You ought to see it when it blooms, all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon, like a sea of blood. Come the dry season, and the world turns the color of old bronze. And this is only hranna, child. There are a hundred kinds of grass out there, grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo, blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows. Down in the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are oceans of ghost grass, taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass. It murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned. The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world, and then all life will end.""ù

It's a very vivid picture Jorah is painting for Dany of the differences grasses around the world especially the murderous ones in Asshai. I always wondered why even include this scene. Why would GRRM spend time having Jorah explain this, and why would the show include a snippet of it as well. Even though it looks innocuous enough, this scene is very telling on Jorah's connection to fertile land. The name '""Jorah""ù does come from a Canaanite God of fertility, yarikh, so GRRM is trying to get the reader to pay attention to that. It doesn't just happen once or twice, the books are littered with Jorah's connection to this important imagery.

Jorah on show chooses Dany over Brother by seeing she needs protection, in book because of her dirty earthiness and her propensity to always love feeling mud between her toes. She lives to be free and that is what makes Jorah be so taken by her. As in he she is embracing living nature (ie mud and grass), which equates to seeing her fertileness. 

Next, could this signal Dany later feeling lost because Jorah is not there with her. Like if she looks behind her she will know that he will no longer be there in last chapter of DWD? Maybe important to analyze in the future. 

This next quote from Dany ch. 3, is Viserys getting lost in the tall grass, which I analyze as Jorah choosing to serve Dany instead of him. Also could be it won't be a male to lead armies to Westeros, it will be Dany. A reversal of the trope that is usually lead by a man in other fantasies but given to a women:

Viserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt. He kept his silence, but he would not move, and his eyes were full of poison as they rode away. Soon he was lost in the tall grass. 

**Dany 4**

Since Jorah's last name is associated with a mountain I wonder if this is a foreshadowing that Dany will have sex with Jorah in the end where he lets her climb on top of his mountain while they have sex:

""Where is the city?"" she asked as they passed beneath the bronze arch. There were no buildings to be seen, no people, only the grass and the road, lined with ancient monuments from all the lands the Dothraki had sacked over the centuries.""ù

""Ahead,"" Ser Jorah answered. ""Under the mountain.""

Dany finds out that only men can climb the mother of mountains""¶Could be a a metaphor for the Dothraki only take women from behind and women can never mount the mountain. Yet, Dany adds a new way for the Drothraki women to be on top during love making. Also at the end of series, she actually climbs the mother of mountains.

So Viserys looks down upon Dothraki in this quote but Dany excepts them and the grass stains. I feel anything associated with grass signals Jorah too:

""I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, not some grass-stained savage with bells in his hair,"" Viserys spat back at her. 

After the fight they have Dany then says:

'""Dany said to him. ""Didn't you learn anything that day in the grass? Leave me now, before I summon my khas to drag you out.""ù

Grass is a very important theme in this book and the last book DWD especially, although there are more instances of Jorah associated with him and nature. 

**Dany 5**

Then introduced in next sentence womb of world:

They rode to the lake the Dothraki called the Womb of the World, surrounded by a fringe of reeds, its water still and calm. A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emerged from its depths, riding upon the back of the first horse 

Can this equate to someone who has first man like Jorah blood riding a horse like a knight? Also that water has to do with calmness and peace.

Then there is a love scene between Dany and Drogo. As if her swimming in it lead to that 

Like Dan's fertility and swimming in the womb of the world, makes Drogo more sexual. As if a perfectly fertile girl of age makes any man feel sexual. Jorah is a fertile man only with the right womb. He tried with other 2 wives but no dice on children, maybe with Dany he senses there is more possibilities. 

Which later on, we come to find out Jorah is very protective of Dany and now her eggs from her own brother too:

He had planned to take your dragon's eggs, until I warned him that I'd cut off his hand if he so much as touched them.""ù

For Jorah to be so protective of this is very telling. He goes from protecting her drag eggs to protecting her and her ovaries so he can fertilize them himself. Moreover, he is he one to make sure her eggs are ok. \\In the show, Jorah gets one of my favorite scenes of his with Viserys trying to steal the dragon eggs and he says he won't let him because of '""here I stand""ù line and stance. Its awesome! I feel it made more of an impact as well and showed Jorah willing to do anything it took to keep Dany safe and happy. 

Something else I speculate with there is a lot of replacing going on. I just find it interesting that Dany goes from her womb being fertile and stone dragons eggs to stone ovaries and living dragons as they are describe here:

For a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words. ""My eggs . . . but they're mine, Magister Illyrio gave them to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys want . . . they're only stones . . .  

From death (stone eggs) was given life to dragons killing off a human baby and making the ovaries it came from turned into stone. 

Here Jorah tells Dany how rare the dragon eggs are even using how men would sell there manhoods for one. I think it speaks to Jorah's desperation for Dany since he lust after hence the manhood reference and that he might ultimately revive her own stone eggs and bear a child again:

""The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals, Princess . . . and dragon's eggs are rarer by far. Those traders he's been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those stones, and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need.""

**Dany 6**

After Robert's assassination attempt, you have Dany, for the first time, mention the phrase '""wake the dragon.""ù Her anger is roused when her child is threatened rightfully so. This I feel anyone who gets her pregnant she would be loyal too. Her eyes than shift to the dragons eggs as if she knows it's her destiny to give up her baby for them:

No. He cannot have my son."" She would not weep, she decided. She would not shiver with fear. The Usurper has woken the dragon now, she told herself . . . and her eyes went to the dragon's eggs resting in their nest of dark velvet. The shifting lamplight limned their stony scales, and shimmering motes of jade and scarlet and gold swam in the air around them, like courtiers around a king.

**Dany 9**

We now skip to Dany chapter 9. 

These fever dreams are very important I think it's what made her begin the mother of dragons process. For she kept repeated in some of them: '""You don't want to wake dragon do you?""ù 

The fever dream we get more imagery of grass. At this point I have made a good argument how Jorah is connected to the grass, so when it appears you can pretty much guarantee it could be foreshadowing for Jorah. 

Then comes an image of Dany losing her child and now her body being dry inside:

'""She saw his heart burning through his¬†chest, and in an instant he was gone, consumed like a moth by a candle, turned to ash. She wept for her child, the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast, but her tears turned to steam as they touched her skin.""ù

Then the door comes back but this time whatever is chasing her is described as cold. Also is there was any sign of life in Dany it was now burned up by what looks like the description of Drogon. But her concept of home and the red door still lingers and beyond that door is fertile land again with arms to keep her warm.

'""The door loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings. She could smell home, she could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm, there. She threw open the door.""ù

Of course no mention of Drogo for the '""arms""ù part but Dany spends some time describing Jorah and how he is so strong and fit for a man his age:

Than she sees the door again reaching for it with the ice behind her. It could signal Westeros is not really her home and she will have tray have tp make a decision to leave""¶and who is with her when she makes that decision in season 8""¶Jorah! He has vowed to keep her safe for he does keep coming back to her. He is the red door because he is mentioned again shortly after: 

""The last dragon,"" Ser Jorah's voice whispered faintly. ""The last, the last.""ù

After she awakes from long sleep her mouth feels dry letting the reader now Dany is barren. 

A little while later she awakes and wants nothing more than to hold her dragon eggs as if it's a source of comfort and incubation. She wants to hold her egg and doesn't ask about the child right away like he does on show: 

'""She slept again with her dragon egg. After she woke she felt strong but sweaty with dragon dew""ù

After she knows she should cry for dead baby but felt dry in eyes not tears. What died with that baby was also her hope of normal life. For she could only thinking about taking the 7 kingdoms for herself for she thinks it is her birthright. 

Jorah then comes in with Mirri and Dany asks Jorah to put a hand on the black egg, asking if he feels any heat. Yet, all he can says is he feels a cold stone. But if Jorah would have touched Dany wombs he would have felt heat. She is thinks she is fire and ash, but because she hasn't found the right cold to melt like Jorah coming from cold climate and Dany melting his heart fast. 

Then Dany says that Jorah inadvertently killed her son when he brought her into that test. I wondered if this was maybe the workings of the bear spirit's revenge for all those who took his second wife away. Now that he can have another similar bride and her offspring all to himself, he is cleaning house so to speak. But, Jorah didn't know that that would happen or did he???

Ser Jorah had killed her son, Dany knew. **He had done what he did for love and loyalty**, yet he had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness. He knew it too; the grey face, the hollow eyes, the limp. ""The shadows have touched you too, Ser Jorah,"" she told him. The knight made no reply. Dany turned to the godswife. ""You warned me that only death could pay for life. I thought you meant the horse.""ù

Jorah only did what he thought was best? Hard to say. I wonder if this baby was fed to the darkness because this baby would be pure darkness, do only evil things. The Stallion who mounts the world sounds like it could instill fear in anyone. Maybe there will be a baby of light to bring forth more life.

In her anger Dan still naive to ask when will he be as he was""¶then famous prophecy:

**""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,""** said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you **bear** a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""ù - 

Jorah is sometimes equated with Drogo. For he is a beast but is then tamed by his love for Dany, and she changes him enough where he goes into slavery for her. He pays the price he could have with his second wife, but he didn't. Dany changed Jorah and Jorah changed her into a strong queen. They became each others strength. The fact that the word bear is so much in Dany chapters, I wonder if her next baby will have some bear in them. 

The land where all this happens in no fertile only, dust settles. Signaling her bareness until she mates with Fertile moon god named after Jorah. Actually from the time Drogo fell from his horse Dany settled into dry land and the Dothraki were not having it. But, she still made them camp there. Grass is mentioned first as well:

'""No soft blanket of grass welcomed them here, only the hard dusty ground, bare and strewn with stones. No trees stirred in the wind, and there was no stream to soothe her fears with the gentle music of water""ù

The darkness wants her to believe she will never have children again:

'""Never, the darkness cried, never never never.""ù 

But in this story never say never just like to a certain character pining over another throughout the story when the end is not certain either. 

**Dany 10**

First time we have confirmation from Jorah; his heart was never Viserys but hers alone:

My . . . queen,"" Ser Jorah said, going to one knee. ""My sword that was his is yours, Dacnerys. And my heart as well, that never belonged to your brother. (Fer)

In show he grabs her after this and says he will not watch her burn:

""I understand that you loved him,"" Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair. ""I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her. You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo's pyre. I will not watch you burn.""ù

Yet, he cannot watch her burn. But her inside is already ash and burned up which is maybe why her outside remains intact. Probably important to ponder for the future. Here is the first time Jorah mentions his wife. It seems GRRM brought her up to show his 2nd wife will not be as important as Dan will be. For he will be willing to die for Dan later in the story. 

She has no bride gift to give him but she promises this: 

and turned to the last of her champions. ""Ser Jorah Mormont,"" she said, ""first and greatest of my knights, I have no bride gift to give you, but I swear to you, one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen, dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel. And I would ask for your oath as well.""ù

This is one of my favorite quotes for this section because of it's subtle nature, again, to tell us babies = swords. She had no bride gift to give him then but she will one day. But just like the Azor Ahai prophecies  of lightbringer being a speculative sword, this is the second Azor Ahai/Nissa story where the sword is speaking about an actual baby again. Dany's hands will have a baby and be given to Jorah for he will be their father to signal in spring. This I will explore more in detail in the next sections. 

Jorah finds her again:

'""When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion. She was naked, covered with soot, her clothes turned to ash, her beautiful hair all crisped away . . . yet she was unhurt."" 

In this moment Jorah was the one reborn figuratively and Dany literally like explained in the Azor Ahai prophecy. Dryness gave birth to dragons but the right fertility will give birth to a baby. 

CoK

**Dany 1**

The place they settle looks discarded but soon they all find life and fruit growing in the trees. This is the first time we find out Jorah is truly in love with Dany as a women and not just a queen. This is very  conspicuous imagery on GRRM part to connect Jorah and fertility again. 

Dany relates standing on mountain with something good like flying. Can mounting something also be comparable to having an organism because mounts = sex?? Perhaps: 

'""It would be like standing on a mountaintop, only better""ù

Dany will mount the mountain (Jorah) and feel freer than ever before and have an biggest orgasm ever with ecstasy like flying.

Obviously Jorah has a problem making babies, maybe it was because he too hasn't found the right fit yet. He tells Dany about his 2 previous marriages. Curiously, Jorah has also been married twice before, which can have similar parallel's to Dany's marriages. Jorah's first wife died in botched child birth, his second wife loved her family rich customs more like Hizdahr loved his land's customs seemingly more, so the third marriage between Jorah and Dany will finally find the balance both have been looking for for so long.

After she finds out the truth, Dany tried to picture Jorah while touching herself but it was no use. Yet, I feel it's because her resistance of him is pretty strong. The fact that she even tried was sweet also. She doesn't feel attraction to let it go that far but you know his face kept changing into Drogo. I have pointed out previously that Jorah was the first guy Dany was attracted to even if he couldn't give her the power Drogo did.

**Dany 4** 

I feel the house of the undying was just a whole lotta of nothing. It was to keep Dany stuck there with her dragons forever. By the end of Pyat is dead and she gets out on to green grass with Jorah comforting he. Another connection to Jorah's fertility through the imagery of grass where he comforts her in the process. 

SoS

**Dany 2**

I was wondering this, what if Jorah stares at Danys chest to signify she is a fertile being. As if she thinks she's barren but she's very fertile. He sees the potential that she can still be a mother and he's the only man in planetos that can water her plants. Something to ponder again. 

**Dany 3**

At the beginning of this chapter, Jorah is highlighted riding beside Dany through forrest""¶Stem word Jor means forrest in Celtic to showcase his fertility.

There is a lot of nature-based imagery in Dany chapters and a few where two lovers are present. Something to point out, when she can't tell weather they are slave or free without clothing this could be foreshadowing of Dany not caring about Jorah's lower-born status, in the end, and finally except him as her lover/husband:

On another island two lovers kissed in the shade of tall green trees, with no more shame than Dothraki at a wedding. Without clothing, she could not tell if they were slave or free.

**Dany 6**

Dany's banishment of Jorah takes a lot out of her. She lists him amongst people that have been very important to her. Listing Willem Darry first and ending with Jorah:

I weep I will forgive him. Strong Belwas seized Ser Jorah by the arm and dragged him out. When Dany glanced back, the knight was walking as if drunk, stumbling and slow. She looked away until she heard the doors open and close. Then she sank back onto the ebony bench. He's gone, then. My father and my mother, my brothers, Ser Willem Darry, Drogo who was my sun-and-stars, his son who died inside me, and now Ser Jorah . . .

When Dany is seen on her balcony overlooking her city, She pictures Jorah leaving and of course pictures him living amongst lush vegetation to link him with fertility again, as well as a simple life that she so craves (of course not a coincidence):

""Leave him be. The scales are balanced now. Let him go home."" Dany pictured Jorah moving amongst old gnarled oaks and tall pines, past flowering thornbushes, grey stones bearded with moss, and little creeks running icy down steep hillsides. She saw him entering a hall built of huge logs, where dogs slept by the hearth and the smell of meat and mead hung thick in the smoky air. ""We are done for now,"" she told her captains. 

**DwD**

**Dany 1**

Dany and fertility imagery again in Dance With Dragons:

The Great Pyramid shouldered eight hundred feet into the sky, from its huge square base to the lofty apex where the queen kept her private chambers surrounded by greenery and fragrant pools. As a cool blue dawn broke over the city, Dany walked out onto the terrace. To the west sunlight blazed off the golden domes of the Temple of the Graces, and etched deep shadows behind the stepped pyramids of the mighty. 

Fruit = sweetness and this before Jorah is mentioned: 

Viserion sensed her disquiet. The white dragon lay coiled around **a pear tree**, his head resting on his tail. When Dany passed his eyes came open, two pools of molten gold. His horns were gold as well, and the scales that ran down his back from head to tail. ""You're lazy,"" she told him, scratching under his jaw. His scales were hot to the touch, like armor left too long in the sun. Dragons are fire made flesh. She had read **that in one of the books Ser Jorah had given her as a wedding gift.** ""You should be hunting with your brothers. Have you and Drogon been fighting again?"" Her dragons were growing wild of late. Rhaegal had snapped at Irri, and Viserion had set Reznak's tokar ablaze the last time the seneschal had called. I have left them too much to themselves, but where am I to find the time for them?

Nice connection between dragons, Jorah and his bride gift to Dany. All this amongst sweet fruit and nature again. 

**Dany 4**

Sometimes Dan can seem wise pertaining to this story:

He shall be the stallion that mounts the world. Dany knew how it went with prophecies. **They were made of words, and words were wind**

Prophecy = bad omen or come to nothings

Yet she mentions the prophecy of her being barren. She excuses one prophecy and explains why it wont happen with another""¶she is strange. That how they can become embedded in you so much to confuse. 

Dan seems to naively think that any king who wants to marry her like Hizdahr will make her heart flutter. But we all know it doesn't take a king, just a man to send awaken something in her like Jorah did kissing her on the boat, and maybe awaken a living baby also:

Hizdahr took her by the shoulders as tenderly as if she were a baby bird. Leaning forward, he pressed his lips to hers. His kiss was light and dry and quick. Dany felt no stirrings. 

'""Then she tells him very disappointed: ""I do not love you.""ù

But Hiz tells that can come later which it did when Dany became pregnant with Drogo's baby. But I'm sure she won't get pregnant by him as icy as he is, and not the right kind of icy like Jorah who is completely melted by now from his love for Dany. Another thing, Dany knows that anything awakened in her relates to love for she can distinguish between a kiss of love and one of duty. Jorah's kissed her and it sent her reeling, because that is a kiss of pure love. Therefore if you the reader ever had a question as to whether Jorah loved Dany, well here is your answer. 

Barristan does not approves and tells her Westeros is her real home. I disagree because she will not find this:

""In Westeros you will be the lost child who returns to gladden her father's heart. Your people will cheer when you ride by, and all good men will love you.""ù

From the way the show is going there seems to be no such homecoming in sight, so far.

The cold always takes away the fire. Ice = duty and fire = love when it pertains to this quote:

""Her duty."" The word felt cold upon her tongue

Dany seems sad about fulfilling anything in regards to duty, what she wants in true love, but she is suppressing it from the man I think she truly loves, Jorah. She obviously knows the difference between duty and true love with the His kissing scene, but because she feels she doesn't belong to herself anymore when being queen, she settles for the duty. 

**Dany 10**

Really great chapter, every you read it there is greenery to make way for Jorah imagery. 

She hasn't said this phrase in a while:

Also a silver moon.

She thinks of everything and everyone who has ever made her happy""¶starting with Jorah: 

Ser Jorah had been with her then, her gruff old bear. She'd had Irri and Jhiqui and Doreah to care for her, her sun-and-stars to hold her in the night, his child growing inside her. Rhaego. I was going to name him Rhaego, and the dosh khaleen said he would be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Not since those half-remembered days in Braavos when she lived in the house with the red door had she been as happy. 

Dany then says:

'""She still clung to the hope that someone would come after her.""ù

At this point in show both Jorah and Daario come to her rescue.

Despite taming Drog she still couldn't get him to do what she wanted. 

Imagery the way she use to live with the Doth and maybe the moment Jor began to love her:

This is the time we as the reader detect that Dany has been talking to the grass. Its as if she ca hear the grass speaking to her as well, a build up to something. The grass sounded sad from its sighing: 

It was quiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed against each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now and again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. Mud squished between her toes.

Here she is preparing to picture Jorah because of the grass talking to her. The day Jorah chose to serve her over Viserys, was the day he saw her by modest means, embracing a culture and wanting to be free she also had mud between her toes too.

Now she is talking to the grass:

'""Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and now I've flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. ""Men are mad and gods are madder,""ù she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement.""ù 

This reads as she could only picture a voice coming from the grass that brings her comfort and safety. 

The image of the mon rising above grass finally lulls her to sleep:

'""moon rose above the grasslands, Dany slipped at last into a restless sleep.""ù

Then she wakes up with blood on her thighs could be a miscarriage or her period. But she reasons its can't be her period b/c of the crescent moon. What represents a crescent moon - a sickle maybe. Like Yarikh, the Canaanite moon god where Jorah gets his name from. This could be symbolism for Jorah being the key to Dany's fertility problems. 

She then speaks to the grass again: 

The one before that? No, it cannot have been so long as that. ""I am the blood of the dragon,"" she told the grass, aloud.""ù

'""Once, the grass whispered back, until you chained your dragons in the dark.""ù

""Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was ""¶ her name ""¶"" Dany could not recall the child's name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. ""I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.""ù

'""Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children""ù

With this mini conversation when finally start distinguishing the voice coming from the grass is someone familiar to her, who maybe gave her good council in the past. Here the grass wants her to embrace her internal dragon, maybe this voice is attached to the one that will help her slay it?

More imagery of her feet in mud which helps sooth her painful sores:

The soft brown mud felt good between her toes and helped to soothe her blisters.

Than after saying she must go home to Meereen she realizes Meereen will never be home and then the grass starts sounding like someone familiar to Dan now:

'""Never, said the grass, in the gruff tones of Jorah Mormont. You were warned, Your Grace. Let this city be, I said. Your war is in Westeros, I told you.""ù

'""The voice was no more than a whisper, yet somehow Dany felt that he was walking just behind her.""ù

If she looks back she is lost for Jorah is no longer there to keep her safe. She doesn't want that realization 

because she will truly feel lost, but if he was by her side she wouldn't need to look behind her. Than she realizes anyway how much she has missed him and wished she could hug him. Or maybe in that moment his strong arms would keep her safe again:

'""My bear, she thought, my old sweet bear, who loved me and betrayed me. She had missed him so. She wanted to see his ugly face, to wrap her arms around him and press herself against his chest, but she knew that if she turned around Ser Jorah would be gone.""ù

Out of all the men that were in her life its Jorah she pictures and speaks to. 

""I am dreaming,"" she said. ""A waking dream, a walking dream. I am alone and lost.

Lost, because you lingered, in a place that you were never meant to be, murmured Ser Jorah, as softly as the wind. Alone, because you sent me from your side. (fer, EG)

just as I said. 

""You betrayed me. You informed on me, for gold.""ù

For home. Home was all I ever wanted. ""And me. You wanted me.""ù

This shows that Jorah isn't the betrayal for gold, he wanted home above all else. It's true that is all he ever wanted. But his love for her still makes her uncomfortable, but in a queenly way not a woman way:

'""Dany had seen it in his eyes.""ù

'""I did, the grass whispered, sadly.""ù

""You kissed me. I never said you could, but you did. You sold me to my enemies, but you meant it when you kissed me.""ù

She only says that because he is a knight and thinks knights need to act accordingly. She thinks they need to be pure and pious when it comes to their queen or lady. But what will happen when Dany realizes she isn't the rightful queen anymore. Will she still resist him?

Even as grass Jorah still gives her advise:

'""I gave you good counsel. Save your spears and swords for the Seven Kingdoms, I told you. Leave Meereen to the Meereenese and go west, I said. You would not listen.""ù

""I had to take Meereen or see my children starve along the march.""

'""Dany could still see the trail of corpses she had left behind her crossing the Red Waste. It was not a sight she wished to see again. ""I had to take Meereen to feed my people.""ù

She was thinking of them but she still had to go to Westeros because she has to help fight the others with the dragons but then leave for truer home with Jorah:

'""You took Meereen, he told her, yet still you lingered. ""òTo be a queen.'""ù

You are a queen, her bear said. In Westeros. ""It is such a long way,""ù

He is only saying she is queen to get her there but than will realizes she was never meant to be queen there. Dany is more of a savior/conqueror than ruler. Ruling is more grueling than taking something over:

'""she complained. ""I was tired, Jorah. I was weary of war. I wanted to rest, to laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only a young girl.""ù 

She really is just a normal girl who wants a normal life, but the grass says otherwise:

'""No. You are the blood of the dragon. The whispering was growing fainter, as if Ser Jorah were falling farther behind. Dragons plant no trees. Remember that. R",SPOILER

"**Bear Ritual Analysis**

For this section I have extracted quotes from a fascinating bear symbolism discussion on asoiaf forum that I think will be very useful to prove that Jorah's bear spirit might be exacting some kind of revenge against those who have wronged into exile in indirect ways. I quoted one by the username of sweetsunray from their bear and the maiden fair analysis thread. 

""The best known and last remaining legend of Germanic origin (Germanic '""Wayland""ù and Norse ""òVolund""ù) about a bear is a warning of what may happen if the bear-hunt-ritual goes wrong. Indirectly, the legend tells us that the bear is killed in his sleep in his den (which is foul murder), then denied his bride (a princess) and his spirit kept as a prisoner to extort game from him for years by a greedy, evil king. The king also steals his ring and sword, giving it to his daughter, the princess, and thereby making her a shieldmaiden. Eventually the bear-spirit manages to escape and exacts his revenge on the king who abused him so. He kills the king's heirs, seduces the king's daughter and he only flies off as a bird (his spirit form) after he has their promise that the princess' child will be the recognized heir, thereby establishing a totemic bear ancestral bloodline.""ù

The layers hiding the bear

'""Of course, if you read the legend itself, you seem to be reading about a smith, whose swan-wife has flown off south (winter season), living by himself in middle of the forest. He has a stash of 700 rings and a sword (representing the riches and game of the forest and his protection of them), and is renowned for the amount of treasure he makes. He falls asleep on a bear skin (winter sleep) and wakes to bear steaks roasting on the fire, and discovers he's been taken prisoner (he's already dead, and being roasted, but the man spirit doesn't know it). He is brought before the queen, who proclaims him too low of birth to be married to her daughter, the princess. Then he is hamstringed (a euphemism for being emasculated) so he can't run away, and ordered to continue to make riches and jewels for the king. When he can have his revenge, the beheading of the king's sons restores his hamstrings (his balls), after which he seduces the princess in a type of mock marriage and gets her with child, to then fly off as a bird.""ù

Jorah had a swan wife in Lynesse but she never came back so he went looking for her and found someone who could have been a copy to him in Dany. But younger and better in his eyes, since she didn't have a poor personality. 

'""""òLords of the forest' who protect the game, and basically their spirit = forest. They are believed to be skinchanging men, because a naked bear (skinned) looks like a man, and thus could understand human speech. Because of the latter euphemistic names and titles evolved for bears, as well as certain hidden ways to talk about hunting intentions, because it was feared the bear could otherwise understand them. The bear's potent nature was a possible sexual danger to the unwed women or girl, and wards were used by women for protection.""ù

As I mentioned before the stem word '""Jor""ù in the Celtic language means '""forest""ù. Therefore, when GRRM choose Jorah for a name and gave him a bear sigil, he knew he would be some kind of lord to Bear island and a protector to someone very special. Also a Jorah's last name of Mormont could be roughly translated into '""dark mountain""ù another natural phenomenon in a forest. 

'""They'd pretend to carry him to a wedding like a groom, and a ritualistic wedding between a chosen maiden and the killed bear would be performed. The woman's later bloodline could then claim a totemic bear ancestry. Finally, the bear-spirit would be freed through burrial, and then it would take the shape of a bird to fly back to its brothers and relate how well he was treated. This hunt was done to ensure a yearlong blessing on hunting all other forest game.""ù

If bloodlines are to continued by the bear than Jorah will help continue the targ line. Dany will stop resisting the bear and bed him finally. They will have a child and for the bear to show his gratitude to his bride he will give up his name and take hers.

""A bear is both a protector as well as a provider. In legends therefore we often see a bear character as a warrior-smith with a legendary sword and treasure crafted by himself, but coveted by others.""ù

Many already believe that Jorah can be Azor Ahai, this little excerpt could be an important key to get him there. 

So Jorah having the blood of the dragon in the baby and from beginning when he said blood of my blood. So a lot of this prophecy stuff can come from rituals. For doth believe that blood riders are of one body mind and spirit with their Khal/ Khaleesi like when ppl get married? Also the hidden bear is the one you would least expect to be the true hero of the series because of his ugly, creepy, complex, nature I of course speak about Jorah

Sounds familiar:

'""The bear/man is driven wild with desire by the female scent, and most likely the scent of the honey between her legs. Here the bear is described as a testosterone filled man. The fifth stanza ends the previous hunting ritual codex, as the bear approves of the chosen bride for the bear wedding. But it is also the start of the cultural wedding custom between a man and a woman. It is therefore a bridging stanza.""ù

'""Even if the unwed woman desires the man herself, she must protest against him. She must be a reluctant bride. A proper maiden is expected to be proud of her maidenhood, preferring to keep it than voluntarily give it away.""ù

This is exactly what Dany does to Jorah, she resists him in tantrum-like, girlish displays of protest. In her mind heart and soul, she knows it's the only way she can become queen. She is no proper maiden however but in this story as I pointed out, maidenhood = had no living baby yet, so she flaunts her other lovers in Jorah's face yet she still asks him in certain ways to fight for her. She doesn't just want to give any semblance of her fertility away until she finds the right fit. 

 **Quote**

*6. Oh, I'm a maid, and I'm pure and fair!*

*I'll never dance with a hairy bear!*

*A bear! A bear!*

*I'll never dance with a hairy bear!*

In the next stanza, despite her verbal protests, the groom-bear picks up his bride to carry her off to bed. He steals her.

Jorah stole a kiss from the one he wants as a bride, he could actually be one to steal her towards the end and make her his. 

 **Quote**

*7. The bear, the bear!*

*Lifted her high into the air!*

*The bear! The bear!*

The following stanza's instructs the maiden to keep protesting, even while she's being carried off. She wanted a knight, and instead she gets a bear. A woman should be demanding. The man must prove his worth: that he can protect and provide for her, like a bear, and can fight for her like knight.

I keep bringing up the show, but that doesn't mean the characters are not going to end up in the same place as the books, so I think it still counts. The scene with Jorah and Tyrion being captured by savers and Tyrion is trying to get the lead slaver to take them to slaver's bay because Jorah is a legendary fighter. Jorah seals the deal by telling the slaver to put a sword in his hand and he will prove his worth. His worth as a knight and protector to his queen who he loves dearly. So he's proven himself as a bear to Dany for she has adopted herself as his cub for his great protection of her and as a knight for his fighting skills and council have become invaluable to her. 

 **Quote**

*8. I called for a knight, but you're a bear!*

*A bear, a bear!*

*All black and brown and covered with hair*

The final stanza's I have discussed in a previous essay already, but I will discuss them some more here as well. Remember that 2 stanza's before that, the bear lifted the maiden to carry her off. In this stanza she physically protests. First she has to say ""no"", then she must make ""demands"" and finally she must fight him, requiring the man to prove his strength. The woman must kick and scream and scratch and put up a fight, and the man is required to sexually please her, so she can finally give in, ending in a customary ""happy match"". Do they have a similar custom as the wildlings in Qohor?

 **Quote**

*9. She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair,*

*But he licked the honey from her hair.*

*Her hair! Her hair!*

*He licked the honey from her hair!*

Yes, folks the kiss was only the beginning, Jorah will eventually steal the bride to be and bed her as she still puts up a fight but like she usually said she thinks about him without even wanting too. 

**Quote**

*10. Then she sighed and squealed and kicked the air!*

*My bear! She sang. My bear so fair!*

*And off they went, from here to there,*

*The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair.*

The euphemistic name for a bear in some regions (Baltic) is '""honey licker""ù. More suggestively, the bear's penis is also called '""honeyed""ù. The licking of the honey from the maiden's hair thus can mean both '""oral sex""ù as well as copulation.

That's why Jorah's kiss tasted sweet to Dany, because Jorah's sweetness is on the inside not the outside. His redemptive arc will give him the inner beauty that needs to shine through for Dany to finally see the prince hiding in there somewhere and except him as her final lover and father to her offspring. 

**Conclusion**

""The song in its totality first describes the hunting of the bear by three hunters, involving trickery, lies of innocence and scapegoating and the bear-wedding, secondly a custom of stealing a woman as well as pleasing a woman sexually.""ù

'""Within the books '""dance""ù has a double meaning. The word 'dance' is regularly used to indicate a 'fight'.""ù

Another interesting tidbit is the dancing bears. Did you guys know Jorah is a dancing bear for he dances every time he sword fights, because in this story fencing is seen as dancing. Also In show during the dance of dragons episode the bear and the dragon are dancing as Dany sees Jorah in the fighting pits and at first she acts like she wants him to die there but the more close calls he has the more she can't resist her true feelings any longer that she loves him and would be crushed if he died.",SPOILER
" Every couple of years i like to reread this classic by Marion Zimmer Bradley. This last reread though, was the first time since reading through the entire a song of ice and fire books. Is it just me or does anyone else see lots George must of been inspired from?

Yes i am familiar with the theories and essays making the connecting between the legend of king arthur (Radio Westeros' Lady Gwen for one) and some elements in the asoiaf books but i felt like the specific tone and perspective in the Mists of Avalon are very prevalent in grrms writing. What ya'll think??",SPOILER
"**Beauty and The Beast Parallels P. 2**

 Here Dany smells Jorah's sweat and calls it earthy compared to the fruity perfumes warn by the slavers. She likes his smell. She enjoys his scent in the dry air. Bear and the Maiden Fair reference again. But the maid likes the scent not just the bear. 

Everyone is always so weary of Dany. Well she is so temper-filled. But Jorah knows her too well and Dany doesn't stop him either from:

'""The crew left her alone as they went about their business, but Ser Jorah soon joined her by the rail. He is never far, Dany thought. He knows my moods too well.""ù

Dany is trying to come to terms with fantasy and reality. She wonders why people make up fates to explain a low level persons position and people in authority don't protect those low born than them. For Viserys should have protected her but he abused her worse. 

Here Jorah comforts Dany. Despite his creepy ways, he still good enough to Dany for her to allow him to do this: 

'""Ser Jorah had no answer. He only smiled, and touched her hair, so lightly. It was enough""ù

Dany knows Jorah really well. She senses his anger when the titan comes on to her. She knows he doesn't like talk of kissing. And something new she calls him her black bear...probably after she liked what she smelled in his armor in heat. Kind of like the two beasts liking each others smell.

She goes on to compare Daario and Jorah:

'""And Daario Naharis made her laugh, which Ser Jorah never did.""ù 

Dany SoS her chapter 5.

The prince made Beauty feel good for a time but the beast didn't""¶until the very end!

But then she thinks about marrying both anyway in the same chapter, how can that be if you don't love the person:

'""Khal Drogo could be cruel as well, and there was never a man more dangerous. She had come to love him all the same. Could I love Daario? What would it mean, if I took him into my bed? Would that make him one of the heads of the dragon? Ser Jorah would be angry, she knew, but he was the one who'd said she had to take two husbands. Perhaps I should marry them both and be done with it.""ù

Then the famous banishing scene Dany misses Jorah already: 

'""My bear, my fierce strong bear, what will I do without him?""ù 

Dany Chapter 6 it takes a lot for her not to think about him while he is in the sewers:

Once he comes back a bit proud she knows she can't forgive his insolence:

'""This is Jorah, my fierce bear, the right arm that never failed me. I would be dead without him, but . . . ""I can't forgive you,"" she said. ""I can't.""

""Daenerys,"" he said, ""I have loved you.""ù  

Equates him with the people who have meant so much to her""¶like beauty does for beast:

'""Then she sank back onto the ebony bench. He's gone, then. My father and my mother, my brothers, Ser Willem Darry, Drogo who was my sun-and-stars, his son who died inside me, and now Ser Jorah . . .""ù

'""The way before her was fraught with hardship, bloodshed, and danger. Ser Jorah had warned her of that. He'd warned her of so many things . . . he'd . . . No, I will not think of Jorah Mormont.""ù 

I will extract some quotes and analyze them and how it pertains to Jorah and Dany's story. This is all from Andrew Lang's Beauty & the Beast version written in 1889:

When the Beauty's Father is returning from long dismayed journey comes to Beast's castle:

'""It seemed to the merchant very strange that no snow had fallen in the avenue, which was entirely composed of orange trees, covered with flowers and fruit.""ù

Wants to share castle with family when he realizes there is no one there:

'""Then he went down into the garden, and though it was winter everywhere else, here the sun shone, and the birds sang, and the flowers bloomed, and the air was soft and sweet.""ù

Interesting how such a small things as a rose could rouse a beast into anger and say those are his most treasured possession. Lesson: in the midst of such luxurious stuff a flower can be the most beautiful thing in this world. As if to say it's not status or wealth should make you happy but true love. Comes to everyone mostly as a once in a life time opportunity. Dany and Jorah?

When rose asked for:

Who could have guessed that to ask for a rose in the middle of summer would cause so much misery?

Beauty enjoys the ride just like Dany when given her silver but then realizing her terror when taking her to her bedding of Drogo:

'""as they mounted together the horse which had brought him back. It seemed to fly rather than gallop, but so smoothly that Beauty was not frightened; indeed, she would have enjoyed the journey if she had not feared what might happen to her at the end of it.""ù

'""all the forest was illuminated by them, and even felt pleasantly warm, though it had been bitterly cold before. This lasted until they reached the avenue of orange trees, where were statues holding flaming torches, and when they got nearer to the palace they saw that it was illuminated from the roof to the ground, and music sounded softly from the courtyard. '""The Beast must be very hungry,""ù said Beauty, trying to laugh, '""if he makes all this rejoicing over the arrival of his prey.""ù

'""Beauty spent three months very contentedly in the palace. Every evening Beast paid her a visit, and talked to her, during supper, very rationally, with plain good common sense, but never with what the world calls wit; and Beauty daily discovered some valuable qualifications in the monster, and seeing him often had so accustomed her to his deformity, that, far from dreading the time of his visit, she would often look on her watch to see when it would be nine, for the Beast never missed coming at that hour. There was but one thing that gave Beauty any concern, which was, that every night, before she went to bed, the monster always asked her, if she would be his wife. One day she said to him, ""Beast, you make me very uneasy, I wish I could consent to marry you, but I am too sincere to make you believe that will ever happen; I shall always esteem you as a friend, endeavor to be satisfied with this.'""ù

**'""**It is true, I do not feel the tenderness of affection for him, but I find I have the highest gratitude, esteem, and friendship; I will not make him miserable, were I to be so ungrateful I should never forgive myself."" Beauty having said this, rose, put her ring on the table, and then laid down again; scarce was she in bed before she fell asleep, and when she waked the next morning, she was overjoyed to find herself in the Beast's palace.""ù

""No, dear Beast,"" said Beauty, ""you must not die. Live to be my husband; from this moment I give you my hand, and swear to be none but yours. Alas! I thought I had only a friendship for you, but the grief I now feel convinces me, that I cannot live without you.""ù

Dany says almost the same thing to Jorah in events after he forcibly kisses her on a boat headed to Astopar. 

A dream she had""¶""ùShe thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace gardens, **when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave**, and running quickly to see what could be the matter, she found the Beast stretched out upon his side, apparently dying. He reproached her faintly with being the cause of his distress, and at the same moment a stately lady appeared, and said very gravely""ù

In the book Dany hears Jorah's voice coming from the grass in DWD. 

And then she dreamed that she was walking by a brook bordered with trees, and lamenting her sad fate, when a young prince, handsomer than anyone she had ever seen, and with a voice that went straight to her heart, came and said to her, '""Ah, Beauty! you are not so unfortunate as you suppose. '""Ah, Beauty! you are not so unfortunate as you suppose. Here you will be rewarded for all you have suffered elsewhere. Your every wish shall be gratified. Only try to find me out, no matter how I may be disguised, as I love you dearly, and in making me happy you will find your own happiness. Be as true-hearted as you are beautiful, and we shall have nothing left to wish for.""ù

This has all to do with Skin changing for the beast will change into a prince. I think GRRM won't change Jorah's physical appearances but he is changing his personality in a redemption because and for Dany's love. Love is practically making him a better person toward inner beauty that Jorah will hold in the end. 

'""Only be grateful,""ù he answered, '""and do not trust too much to your eyes. And, above all, do not desert me until you have saved me from my cruel misery.""ù

That desert me part reminds me of Dany imagining Jorah telling her through the grass that she doesn't have banished him and sent him away from her side. 

After this she thought she found herself in a room with a stately and beautiful lady, who said to her:

'""Dear Beauty, try not to regret all you have left behind you, for you are destined to a better fate. 

Only do not let yourself be deceived by appearances.""ù

Jorah or even Quaithe telling Dany so many times not to be deceived by appearances of people trying to flatter her. 

'""Beauty found her dreams so interesting that she was in no hurry to awake, but presently the clock roused her by calling her name softly twelve times""ù

Reminds me of all those times Dany doesn't want to wake from her dreams especially of the red door. This is all with a twist for Jorah is lowborn but he can give her in his love for her freedom, protection and simplicity. 

'""It seems, then, that this horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner. How can I set him free? I wonder why they both told me not to trust to appearances? I don't understand it.

Even though Beauty is well read she still is naive just like Dany:

'""It seems, then, that this horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner. How can I set him free? I wonder why they both told me not to trust to appearances? I don't understand it.

This harkens back to when Dany is trying to picture Jorah when touching herself she could only think about someone younger and handsome, but his face is in shadows. I wonder if GRRM will uncover his face and Dany will realize it was Jorah she imagined the whole time but now sees the inner beauty that grew in him because of her. 

The tones of the beast are described as gruff as well. Just like GRRM describes Jorah's tone at times, but Dany enjoys his tone of voice all the same.

Despite some hit or misses, the show has done a tremendous job of seeing Dany's need for Jorah in her life and how he fulfills a very important role without the stereotypical romantic gestures. However, there does exists some form of romance between the characters in a more pure and organically grown true love I feel. 

As Beauty anticipates her dreams with the prince, she forgets about the beast. Reminds me of Dany always getting so worked up in lustful feelings that she forgets about Jorah who loves her purely in GRRM terms which is a complex way. This statement of mine is going to be controversial for those feel Jorah is nothing but a creep, but I feel he might sense Dany loves him and is not one to give up so easily. Like when Azor Ahai tempered his blades, he was also known not to give up so easily. 

Now Beauty is asking for home and Beast feels she will desert him. GRRM might twisted the home issue in his own story where Dany feels she has no home for she has never felt stable. Only thing she felt was home was the house with the red door. Unlike Jorah who had a home in Bear Island, and gave it up when he went into exile. Now that he has the opportunity to go home, he realizes, in his growing love for Dany, that that is not his hone any longer and his home now is wherever she will always be. 

Beast relents to her request:

'""I cannot refuse you anything you ask, even though it should cost me my life.""ù

Jorah feels he cannot live without Dany, by some manner, out of his life. Like Iain Glen, the actor who plays Jorah, said '""He doesn't really care for life without her.""ù 

Here Jorah always happens to be described in a place of lush vegetation to signal some kind of fertility ability maybe?:

Then she went to bed, but could hardly sleep for joy. And when at last she did begin to dream of her beloved Prince she was grieved to see him stretched upon a grassy bank, sad and weary, and hardly like himself.

The prince was on a grassy bank such a she was after coming out of the house of the undying and Jorah comforted her there. 

Dany needs to marry for political reasons and elevate her status firmly as queen in Westeros but she just can't let Jorah go. She sees his valuable council but also that he is bows out modestly from stealing her so her dreams of becoming queen are realized. So his happiness in that is enough to serve her faithfully. He puts his dreams aside for hers. At least that is the way the show has showcased the relationship and I think it's wonderfully and sad all at once. Just like this in beauty and the beast:

 '""Beauty could not help seeing that this seemed very probable; still, when she thought of her dear Prince who was so handsome, she did not feel at all inclined to marry the Beast. Beauty found that nothing amused her very much; and she often thought of the palace, where she was so happy, especially as at home she never once dreamed of her dear Prince, and she felt quite sad without him.""ù

There is also another reversal here. Beauty's family begs her to stay in a twisted sense like Dany's thinks her family would want her to take back the iron throne back. Beauty would give up her dream of meeting her prince, Dany gives up her dream of a simple life with family by her side. Very interesting. 

This last part may seem like a stretch but Dany hears Jorah's voice coming from the grass in her last chapter in a Dance of Dragons and this is what Beauty hears when the Beast is laid out by thorn bushes:

'""until at last she had a dismal dream which helped her to make up her mind. She thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace gardens, when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave, and running quickly to see what could be the matter, she found the Beast stretched out upon his side, apparently dying.""ù

In the show Dany sees Jorah almost die in the fighting pits and I think in that moment she realizes she loves him but must resist him so she can take back the iron throne eventually. She realizes she might have to marry for duty and not for love. 

'""Oh! Beast, how you frightened me!""ù she cried. '""I never knew how much I loved you until just now, when I feared I was too late to save your life.""ù

Here Beauty is relieved when he is alive, there might be something in the books where Jorah has a death scare in front of Dany to mirror the shows scene in the fighting pits and realizes in that moment she loves Jorah. After this Beauty is happy to see the Beast again maybe like Dany is happy to see Jorah again in season 7, but knows she still has to resist him. Jorah also has to resist her which is why he bows out after kissing her hand and seeing Jon approach. He knows she needs the allies in Westeros to cement herself as queen on the iron throne so he gives her up for her dream. I don't think she truly loves Jon, I think she loves him as a queen but not a man. The man she loves is Jorah, she just can't love him because he can't give her what she needs to play the role of rightful queen of the 7 kingdoms. But what will happen when she realizes that Jon is the rightful heir? She might loose power, be furious, who knows. Or it can have her breathe a sigh or relief and now she could live the life she truly wants with the man she loves, Jorah. Notice how it all coincides with the end, just like the end of this classic tale where Beauty realizes she loves the beast and the beast transforms into the prince from her dreams. And they live happily ever after. The end can be bittersweet in that regard. Bitter because it took Dany so long and so much pain to realize that she loved Jorah all along and it transformed him into a better man for it (the sweet part). There might be also something more interesting left for the en between these two but I will reveal what I think that is in another section. ¬†

Finally 2 women enter, one that happens to be a queen

'""Well, Queen, this is Beauty, who has had the courage to rescue your son from the terrible enchantment. They love one another, and only your consent to their marriage is wanting to make them perfectly happy.

'""I consent with all my heart,""ù cried the Queen.¬†

The queen that will have to consent in GRRM story is Dany herself as she decides to be with Jorah and no one else. Gives up her fight for the iron throne freely to Jon and runs away with Jorah into the the sunset knowing the sun will rise on their love from the east as it always has and always will. 

**Other Similar Fairytales**

In this section I will bring forth other similar story to Beauty and The Beast and the connection between Dany and Jorah. These stories also have to do with skin changing and anthropomorphism. I bring these themes up because GRRM makes Jorah look like the personification of a bear. That beast is seen as a lesser beast and Jorah as just a knight for he is lesser born. 

**From Tale: East of the Sun and West of the Moon**

After she had gone to bed, and put out the light, a man came and laid himself alongside her. It was the white bear, who cast off his pelt at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she had put out the light.¬†

This is Dany sexual fantasies that had Jorah's face changing into Drogo's and someone younger than Jorah's face remaining a shifting shadow. Also interesting how she kept a lion pelt Drogo gave her as a token to remember him by. I feel Dany has to shed any love she had for Drogo to prepare for Jorah and that will include maybe burning that lion pelt. 

When seeing the handsome prince: 

'""So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the same as before. A man came and lay down beside her; but in the middle of the night, when she heard that he was fast asleep, she got up and lit the candle. She let the light shine on him, and saw that he was the most handsome prince one ever set eyes on. She fell so deeply in love with him, that she thought she couldn't live if she didn't give him a kiss at once. And so she did, but as she kissed him she let three drops of hot tallow drip onto his shirt, and he woke up.""ù

This was Jorah's way of falling in love with Dany. He saw the light burning so much inside of her that he couldn't help but give her a deep kiss when he saw her body right in front of him. Yes, it was forced and yes it strange, but remember Jorah knows Dany very well I don't think 

This represents Dany taking on lovers but never finding any lasting love because she hasn't let Jorah's growing inner love and beauty shine through for her. Also because his is still growing but the upcoming books should highlight the change Dany has had on Jorah and Jorah still has on Dany. 

**Brown Bear of Norway:**

'""and when I refused to marry her daughter, she made me take the form of a bear by day, and I was to continue so till a lady would marry me of her own free will, and endure five years of great trials after.""

Dany's trials have to do with these lover(s) just not being right for our Goldilocks. She has to go through the hunters: Drogo, Daario, and Jon to get to her bear that fits""¶Jorah! 

'""She said the only plan was to secure the bear's skin that the prince was obliged to put on every morning, and get it burned, and then he couldn't help being a man night and day, and then the enchantment would be at an end""ù

Another fairy tale that speaks of the love between Jorah and Dany. 

Interesting how Jorah actually takes on the look of a bear and bull, for there are more fairy tales that includes Black Bull of Norroway. 

Also in this story the bear from bear and maiden was black like the bull and brown like the bear. Then Dany refers to Jorah as her big black bear. 

**Jason and Medea**

I bring this one up because Medea fell in love with Jason with help from Aphrodite's scheming and Cupids' arrow. In Medea falling in love with Jason, she helps him in a series of impossible tasks. Sound familiar? Jorah fell in love with Dany and helped her with her almost impossible task of seeking the iron throne. Also, one of Jason's impossible tasks was sowing dragon teeth together to create an army of Spartoi, which means '""Sown men.""ù Well Dany has dragons and because of their desirability, that helps her gain an army of sown men (which have been castrated and sown shut). Who's idea was to get the unsullied, Jorah's!

**Eros and Psyche**

What some of these stories have in common in what the woman will do in her journies to get to the handsome man that would interchange between that and beast. Familiar stories exist all over the world another one is Eros and Psyche. For Eros was beautiful once and fell in love with Psyche, most beautiful of woman. But he only came to her by night as a ugly creature to see if she could fall in love with him for his personality instead of his looks. Yet she couldn't wait and put the candle to his face to expose his true beauty and he fled from her presence. She eventually was given a second chance by Eros, and made immortality to boot. 

**Daughter of the Skies**

A Scottish Tale, which features disappearing daughters and dad who asked a man for help finding them. He agrees only if once found, one of the daughters marries him. So they make a pact and the youngest one agrees to marry the man. He takes her home and he becomes a gracious man. Jorah is changing so in his ugliness he will become a redemptive and great man in Dany's eyes.  

**White Bear King Valemon,**

Lastly this tale in one that takes the cake. This is a Norwegian tale about a white bear to asked for the hand of the youngest daughter. In a dream the youngest saw a golden wreath. Than she sees a white bear with that very same wreath so she wants it for herself but the bear tells her she could only have it if she goes away with him. Now the youngest had 2 other sisters who were ugly so their father the king tried to get the bear to marry them first but whatever the bear tasked the first two with failed for they thought whatever they had before was better. The youngest was the only one who could forget about what she had before with her family. Dany is someone who cannot forget about her past, because she thinks that's what she has to do preserve what her family lost/stolen. But Dany in the end will choose a simpler life in a reversal of fortune scenario and runaway with Jorah.

Dany sees Jorah for what he is and little by little gets exposed to his service, protection, passion, lustful love, and ultimately his true love for her. Yet, GRRM wants the knight to do the impossible tasks for the love of the princess and slay her internal dragon to love her back. Dany's internal dragon will get slain and in the next section I will show how Jorah seems to have a connection to fertile land. I think it will signal something unexpected that everyone says Jon will accomplish in Dany but I think the show runners are going to do a bait and switch on the audience. ",SPOILER
" 

Hello, I'm mostly a serial lurker here because I have unpopular tastes. I like Jorah as a character and a lot of people don't. He is one of the most complex and polarizing character from the book and definitely amongst the fandom. However I first fell in love with the character on the show because Iain Glen does such an amazing job on the Jorah, that I couldn't help it really? One of the things that intrigued me the most about the character was the changes from book to screen. I mean, Iain looks nothing like the book character and I didn't understand why they would change his look so drastically. Seriously, I didn't get it? This became the one of the reason for my curiosity and research. Also, I wanted to know where the character was potentially going, his relationship with Dany and his endgame. Ultimately, what I found really blew my mind in ways I could never imagine. 

With the help of some classic fairytales, myths, legends and GRRM style like imagery from the books, I was able to connect the dots to this new theory I've constructed out of just simple reading and researching related topics. I tried looking to see if anyone had ever connected the dots like this and I could find nothing on the subject of Jorah and his importance to the endgame. The only thing that helped was this website and 2 very interesting discussions on Bear Symbolism and Nissa Nissa I found on asoiaf forum. These were the first discussions that I read on this forum that intrigued me to the character arc of Jorah. Yet, I still wasn't satisfied. I felt I like I needed to look for more clues and put things into perspective. What you are about to read is my own thoughts about the character. Some of you may think I over reaching on somethings or that I'm simply out of my mind but I see the correlations and connections which I hope some of you do as well. 

The beginning of my essay consists of how and why GRRM may have chosen the name for Jorah and the different meanings behind it. Then it will go into his connections to fertility, and why I think Jorah and Dany are meant to be through that. As well as their ice and fire connection and Jorah can actually be Azor Ahai and so on. All this will go into their endgame together. To figure this all out, I will be using both book and show references for my analysis of Jorah. They may be moving in different directions but they have the same endgame. So both the show and books can actually give us interesting clues to our favorite exiled knight. So sit back, relax and enjoy. 

**What's In His Name?**

GRRM seems to invest time in the names he selects for his characters and Jorah is no different. Looking up his name for the first time, I noticed the biblical references. His name only occurs once in the Bible in the book of Ezra on a list referring to one of the names of head's of families who are returning from exile. Seems to suit our knight since he was exiled at one point, but nothing else. 

Then, in the general Hebrew language, it means '""he has been reproached""ù and '""early rain.""ù Lets break this down and see how it can elude to Jorah Mormont. '""He has been reproached""ù could signal his father, Jeor's disappointment to finding out he sold slaves to please his greedy second wife's happiness. Which led to Ned coming to execute Jorah for the crime and him escaping into exile. That one was pretty easy, but then I became intrigued with the '""early rain""ù part. I kept thinking how this could play into Jorah's story. I mean, what does a nearly middle age man have to do with something springlike anyway. 

I put that on the way side however and continued my search. Then I came to something even more intriguing which was Jorah's name having to do with a Canaanite moon god that represents illuminator of heaven, lord of the stars, and lord of the sickle. Also, associated with the Semitic moon god who married the moon goddess Nikkal and through her birth came abundant fertility which in turn, heaven would become fruitful and happy because of the union. I had no idea what this could mean for our Ser Jorah, and again I put that on the back burner. 

Moving on to his last name, I discovered that there exists a small mountain in Switzerland named you guest it, Mormont or Le Mormont to be exact. Another association with something natural like a mountain. Now, when I break the name down further you get Mor and Mont. Now Mont is an informal way of saying mountain in French. On-the-other-hand, Mor is associated with the Moors, a group of nomadic people from North Africa in history who invaded Spain brining the Islamic culture with them. What does this have to do with Jorah, well the most amazing part came from finding out these people were described as '""dark""ù and '""swarthy.""ù Which are the exact terms GRRM describes Jorah in the books in A Game of Thrones. They were also described as obscure, which Jorah is when he meets Dany for he is actually informing on her so he can be given a royal pardon to go back home. Then, when you add mont to the mor part you actually get something that roughly translates to '""dark mountain""ù So a complex picture began to emerge for me about what seemed like an '""ordinary""ù knight at first. 

This is not the end of his name meanings however, this was only the beginning. Around the same vicinity of Le Mormont stands the Jura Mountains - a mountain range that is around the region of the Swiss-French border. The name caught my eye right away because it closely resembled Jorah's name. That's not all, it has a close association with 2 important elements: one is the stem word Jor which in the celtic language means '""forest""ù another association with nature. Also, its a name variation of a familiar name to us like George""¶like our favorite author""¶George RR Martin. When that popped up I was truly amazed. It's too much of a coincidence to ignore. But that is not all. Jorah has that Canaanite moon god association, but now here comes another great moon connection. On the moon there is also a mountain range called Montes Jura that holds an image of a girl they have aptly named '""the moon maiden""ù which has loose associations in A Song of Ice and Fire story. One is where the free folk believe that when the star they've named the red wanderer is in the moon maid they believe that is the right time to steal a woman. Jorah has been in love with Dany for so long he has thought of almost stealing her for himself. He is also a wanderer in his time of exile. Also, there are a few moon maid references in Dany's chapters that connect to Jorah and her relationship throughout the story. This I will describe in the next section. 

**Man and The Moon Maid**

This is first reference of moon maid in Danys story which brings everyone hope:

The next day, dawn broke as they were crossing a cracked and fissured plain of hard red earth. Dany was about to command them to make camp when her outriders came racing back at a gallop. ""A city, Khaleesi,"" they cried. ""A city pale as the moon and lovely as a maid. An hour's ride, no more.""ù (moon maid)

Free folk believe when the warrior is in the moon maid it is best to steal a woman. Jon stole Ygritte than. But I think it will happen again in the last book when Jorah steals Dany for himself by her protesting him until they make love. Just like the bear ritual

The two moons in the sky may not be two moons there at all. But it could be one actually in the sky and the other in the water as it's reflection. For Dany sees the moon in water as she bathes in the lake of womb of world. This could be her connection to it. Then Tyrion says this:

Only the brightest stars were visible, all to the west. A dull red glow lit the sky to the northeast, the color of a blood bruise. Tyrion had never seen¬†a bigger moon. Monstrous, swollen,¬†it looked as if it had¬†swallowed the sun and woken with a fever.¬†Its twin, floating on the sea beyond the ship, shimmered red with every wave.¬†(ADWD, Tyrion)

So if rises in the east and sets in the west always then definitely in the water it looks like it rises in the west and sets in the east. But the water has everything backwards. The water can be a deceiver but it can also bring life. Shades of grey upon it. Grey waters are something in the story. So the 1st moon in the sky is Lyanna and the sky signals death for many go to the night lands in the sky after death. Dany is the second moon in the water which signals life to bring about spring. Lyanna was the first moon and Dany is her reflection in the water (the second moon). They both create water babies, Lyanna with the cost of her life to bring in death (Jon death to winter) and Dany with the cost of her barrenness (death) to bring in life (Spring). 

**Man and the Moon Maid**

Highlighting the moon maid is very important in regards to the Dany and Jorah relationship. In the previous section, I mentioned the Montes Jura on the moon and how the name fits Jorah's name. Something else was found in connection to the Montes Jura and that is the position of a womanly figure situated on it that has come to be referred to as '""The Moonmaid.""ù They say her body is firmly planted in that region of the moon. So what does this have to do with the Dany and Jorah relationship. Well there are a few references in the books to a moon maid and even a freefolk legend as well. But I will stress more those I found in the Dany chapters and what this could mean for Jorah. The first reference of a moon maid in Dany's story comes from A Clash of Kings Dany I. They are wandering through the desert and just when you think they might all perish in the red waste, they find a city which brings everyone hope:

'""The next day, dawn broke as they were crossing a cracked and fissured plain of hard red earth. Dany was about to command them to make camp when her outriders came racing back at a gallop. ""A city, Khaleesi,"" they cried. '""**A city pale as the moon and lovely as a maid. An hour's ride, no more.""ù** 

How the Dothraki explains this city to Dany is both strange but telling. I make the connection because this is also the site where Dany first finds out Jorah is in love with her. This also says a lot about the moon maid on the Montes Jura and how her body is situated on it. GRRM could have reversed this fact for most of the story; Jorah would never have her body but would have her mind by taking his good council. But at the very end would realize she loves him and give herself to him freely. Dany calls Jorah her friend for most of the story just like another very famous heroine did to a very famous beast. Of course I speak of Beauty and The Beast which I will also explore in another section of this essay. 

One more profound connection to this moon maid is when Dany finds out about Jorah's spying and banishes him. This quote comes from A Storm of Swords Dany VI:

'""**Moonlight** streamed through the slanting windows, silvering the marble floors. A cool breeze was blowing through the open terrace doors. Irri slept soundly beside her, her lips slightly parted, one dark brown nipple peeping out above the sleeping silks. For a moment Dany was tempted, but it was Drogo she wanted, or perhaps Daario. Not Irri. **The maid** was sweet and skillful, but all her kisses tasted of duty.""ù

That fact she is not even sure who she wants could also make the reader question whether she truly believes she doesn't even want Jorah either. 

In the next quote right after the first, the moon is dancing in the wind like the maiden who likes to dance as described in the song of the seven:

'""The air was chilly, but she **liked the feel of grass between her toes** and the sound of the leaves whispering to one another. Wind ripples chased each other across the surface of the little bathing pool and made **the moon's reflection dance and shimmer.**""ù

Another interesting tidbit from this quote is Dany always has imagery of mud between her toes and how she likes how it feels. Easily, this could be associated with Jorah for he sees this in the scene after Viserys confronts Dany in the tall grass. She is caked in mud, but sees her strength and decides to follow her over Viserys. 

She thinks of Jorah yet again leaving the city:

'""Perhaps one was Ser Jorah, leading his horse slowly toward the gate. Farewell, old bear. Farewell, betrayer.""ù

In this last quote Dany doesn't mention Jorah but it was the same route she thought he could have taken when he exited the city: 

'""Dany slipped from her¬†arms¬†and stepped out into the predawn air to lean upon the cool brick parapet and gaze out across the city. A thousand roofs stretched out below her, **painted in shades of ivory and silver by the moon.""ù**

'""Somewhere beneath those roofs, the Sons of the Harpy were gathered, plotting ways to kill her and all those who loved her and put her children back in chains. Somewhere down there a hungry child was crying for milk. Somewhere an old woman lay dying. **Somewhere a man and a maid embraced**, **and fumbled at each other's clothes with eager hands.** But up here there was only the sheen of moonlight on pyramids and pits, with no hint what lay beneath. Up here there was only her, alone.""ù

I feel Jorah is the man and the maid will be Dany. Now Dany is not a maid but I always felt like GRRM didn't always mean maid by virginity standards but also someone who has never given birth to a living baby, which Dany clearly has not.  

I now come to the free folk and their legend. Free folk believe when the red wanderer is in the moon maid it is best to steal a woman. Jon stole Ygritte then, but I think it will happen again in the last book when Jorah steals Dany for himself by her protesting him until they make love. I will return this this story in my bear ritual section. For now I explore the legend itself. I see Jorah as a wanderer in this story. The fact that he is exiled from his home and begins to wonder Essos with his second wife who later abandons him, can be connected somewhat. However, when he meets Dany he also devotes his life to her. In turn, he is no longer wandering alone or without purpose but wandering he does continue. Yet the moon maid who Dany has a connection, for she was a technically a maid when she first meets Jorah, has skin as pale as the moon and silver hair. Just in the above quote the moon looks pale but gives off a silvery light at night. It is here Dany tries to picture Jorah as she pleasures herself but his face keeps changing into Drogo's. This I will explain in my section of Skin Changing fairytales. But even if Dany doesn't seem like she desires Jorah, more themes are at play that can explain that she might actually be. 

Dany has a deeper connection to the moon than just this. She, I believe, is the second moon in the sky brought to us by Doreah Qartheen legend and the second Nissa in the story. I won't go into great detail until we get to the AA and NN section. 

**The Red Door References** 

One of the biggest running themes in Dany's story is this red door. What is it? What can it be? We do know some things it's something tied to her past and possibly her future. The craziest thing is she cannot let the image of it go. When she lived in her home with Ser Willem Darry, the house had a red door and Dany spent some of her happiest times there. She lived a simple life free of worries. Not until Ser Willem died did she finally taste sorrow again. Her and her brother Viserys were kicked out of the house with the red door for good. So what is this red door and why did it make such an impact on her? This of course will divulge proof Jorah is the key to this red door and their endgame together. 

This first quote, I will be breaking down to show that after the death of Willem the bear, Jorah the bear came to take responsibility for Dany in some kind of hibernation reincarnation. In the Shamanic tradition is it believed that when the bear hibernates it means their soul is at rest in the spirit world but then comes back as a new rejuvenated being when awoken in spring. GRRM could have killed off Willem but not his spirit where it remained and entered into Jorah for he not only had a bear sigil but had physical resemblance to a bear. This would make Jorah's protection for Dany even double important. I will explore this topic in my bear ritual section further. 

In Dany's first chapter in A Game of thrones we see very subtle similarities between Willem and Jorah. 

Dany describes Willem's hands as leathery and Dany's description of Jorah has him wearing leather a lot around her. They both have saved her life. Willem in this quote:

'""The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast.""ù

A few sentences later mentioned Dany being saved by Willem Darry when she was just '""quickening in her mother's womb""ù Where have we also heard this statement? It comes when Mirri gave her prophecy speech to Dany about how certain things had to happen for her womb to quicken as well so she could have a child of her own. GRRM likes to repeat phrases but sometimes in slight ways to make a point. So in this sense it's like the past meets the present to prepare for the future. I bring up Willem Darry because he is associated with this red door and Braavos. There is speculation that this red door wasn't even in Braavos because of the lemon trees, but frankly most people put to much emphasis on them anyway. It doesn't matter where it was this red door will be very important in Dany's future that's for sure. 

I've also noticed the bear symbol = a beast of some kind. Willem Darry became very beastly in his old age but was always kind to Dany. Also as Willem laid dying he gave off a sweet oder in which indirectly likens to Jorah and his sweet kiss to Dany. The words may not seem like they have much in common but it's the repetition of certain words that should be given notice. The biggest proof in all this is Jorah replacing Willem's image in association with the famous red door. Willem was the past, Jorah meets Dany in the present and is her future along with the red door. 

**Dany 2**

Now this whole concept of home for Dany is the only place that she has ever truly felt safe. Which is Willem Darry's home with the red door. So when Dany's tells Viserys she wants to go home, he automatically thinks it's Westeros but no she means Illyrios's estate:

""Dany wants home, a home frightened her. ""I don't want to be his queen,"" she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. ""Please, please, Viserys, I don't want to, I want to go home.""

'""Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio's estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother did not want to hear that.""ù

She truly wishes she could go back to the house with the red door and feel safe again. It's as if Dany didn't even want to be queen but she just wanted a stable home. Which naturally progresses into the next chapter and scene. 

So the scene in Dany II when Dany asks Jorah later what he prays for, he says home. And that she prayed for home just like him. It is a simple scene but very telling on how much these characters have in common and I suspect they will become each other's home in the future. They both just want normal lives surrounded by love and family. Basically, they are each other's want and need. Funny thing is this is the first time Dany equates home with Westeros but it could also be because of her growing ferocity. For then she says in Dany III:

'""her mind's eye they burned with a thousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind's eye, all the doors were red.""ù 

As I mention, I love what the Game of Thrones did with this scene. The show runners made it even more sweet and effective between Dany and Jorah. You could actually feel the connection being made between the two. 

Once we head into Dany VI Jorah tries to teach Dany patience and not to be foolish like her now dead Brother. 

'""Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons,"" the knight answered. ""Have patience, Princess. Do not make your brother's mistake. We will go home, I promise you.""ù 

Thinking of home again, where is her home truly:

'""Home? The word made her feel sad. Ser Jorah had his Bear Island, but what was home to her? A few tales, names recited as solemnly as the words of a prayer, the fading memory of a red door . . . was Vaes Dothrak to be her home forever? When she looked at the crones of the dosh khaleen, was she looking at her future?""ù

Home seems to make her feel sad because she still doesn't know where that is. Which could be anywhere as long as she had security in place. The way she longs for it it could just be a state of mind and not a specific, physical area. 

I just love that scene in Game of Thrones season 7 episode 2 when Dany makes known she doesn't remember anything about Dragonstone now that she is physically there to witness it. She was also expecting a homecoming and that this place didn't feel like home. Another running theme in Dany's story is the use of fairytale legends and lies fed to her by her brother about Westeroes, whom in turn, believed the nonsensical lies of Illyrio and the common people praying for his return. There was some lies she didn't believe but others she did such as that one. While the show comes to a close we see Dany entitlement getting worse yet longing for something more than she hasn't seemed to find just yet. Maybe where ever that is there will be a red door waiting for her and a certain knight with strong arms to keep her warm at knight? Mayhaps. 

In the show Jorah and Drogo seem to share the same music. That melody called '""Love In The Eyes""ù always signaled Dany and Drogo growing affection for each other but the music was also used for Jorah and his love for Dany. I always thought that was sort of odd but revealing in some way. I will get into this in another section but the reason I bring it up is she think of Drogo in regards to home even though she shared that poignant scene with Jorah and mentioned home in her fever dream in the books: 

""Home,"" she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed, but suddenly the stars were gone, and across the blue sky swept the great wings, and the world took flame.""ù

In the future home will most likely be Jorah considering his face did change into Drogo's in the second book. 

Now I come to the biggest reveal of this red doo in association with Jorah, happening in this very same dream sequence. First time we see Dany dream of Jorah:

'""Ser Jorah's face was drawn and sorrowful. ""Rhaegar was the last dragon,"" he told her. He warmed translucent hands over a glowing brazier where stone eggs smouldered red as coals. One moment he was there and the next he was fading, his flesh colorless, less substantial than the wind. ""The last dragon,"" he whispered, thin as a wisp, and was gone. She felt the dark behind her, and the red door seemed farther away than ever.""ù

Now he is the one connected to the red door and as he fades so does the red door making him and it almost one. Also, as Jorah fades she feels more darkness all around her too. Could this be a foreshadowing to Dany banishing Jorah and that being a big mistake in her life? This can also refer to him having his knight wake her dragon to slay it so they can live happily in a house with a red door and their family. That has her become his true destiny. We also see the image of Drogo one minute than the next its Jorah. Meaning Drogo returns after prophecy but as Jorah all along.

Dany whispering home as if to say she was fine living with Drogo and going home until things were snatched away from her for her true destiny heading to Westeros for a time but not settling there. 

This image represents her going beyond the wall in books and show. Fighting the others is her destiny: 

""**The red door was so far¬†ahead¬†of her**, and she could feel the icy breath behind, sweeping up on her. If it caught her she would die a death that was more than death, **howling forever alone in the darkness.** She began to run.""ù

There is some interesting references to wolves in Dany story and it some instances makes her feel alone. 

Then the door comes back:

'""The door loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings. She could smell home, she could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm, there. She threw open the door.""ù

Arms to keep her warm, previously we had just seen Jorah warming his hands. More revealing connections.  

This posits that fighting the others in Westeros and the red door/home are two separate things. That her true home in not in Westeros but she must go there for a time to help defeat the threat of the others but then retreat and find her real home. Dan and Dave from the show have also gone on record to say Jorah's home is no longer Bear Island, it's where Dany happens to be. Another important correlation as to what was meant by home between Jorah and Dany. 

Again she sees the door and reaches for it with the ice behind her, could signal that Westeros is not really her home and she will have to make a decision to leave""¶and who is with her when she makes that decision in season 8""¶Jorah! He has vowed to keep her safe for he does keep coming back to her. He is the red door because he is mentioned again shortly after: 

""The last dragon,"" Ser Jorah's voice whispered faintly. ""The last, the last."" Dany lifted his polished black visor. The face within was her own.""ù

She is the last dragon, which is a internal one that will have to be slain to have the satisfying conclusion of a home and family she so desires with Jorah by her side. 

It's not until Dany II in A Dance With Dragons that the red door signals Jorah again in a telling way. Instead of Drogo being associated with home/red door it is now Daario:

'""Its night and is stirred by Irri. She was dreaming:""ù 

""Is it Daario? What's happened?"" In her dream they had been man and wife, simple folk who lived a simple life in a tall stone house with a red door. In her dream he had been kissing her all over""îher mouth, her neck, her breasts.""ù

Obviously Daario doesn't seem like the settling down type but Dany still dreams anyway. How she changes her mind so often on who she wants to be with. Anyone can be possible at this point. Jorah's face changes into Drogo's than Drogo to Daario's. It can easily change into Jorah's toward the end. You have to wonder if Drogo's face changed into Daario's at one point than she was maybe attracted to Jorah first for his face changed into Drogo's. 

Yet, one things remains solid is Jorah by her side. 

Next, in the aftermath of Missandei's brother's death Dany tries to comfort her when she realizes she wished someone was comforting her. Jorah did that quiet well especially that scene when he smiled at her, touches her hair lightly and she felt that was enough for her to feel comforted. He knew what she needed when she needed it the most. Know one knows her moods like him. Even the show stresses that a lot. 

Again she mentioned Willem Darry which we all know is associated with Jorah when wanting to feel safe:

""No one ever kept me safe when I was little. Well, Ser Willem did, but then he died, and Viserys ""¶ I want to protect you but ""¶ it is so hard. To be strong. I don't always know what I should do. I must know, though. I am all they have. I am the¬†queen¬†""¶ the ""¶ the ""¶""ù

Confusion sets in, and Jorah is not there to help her. Even though she knows he was the best one to help her out. 

In Dany Chapter 9 in DWD she uses this red door to escape her reality from thinking she must be a proper queen and think of others before her own happiness. Yet she keeps dreaming: 

'""She would rather have drifted in the fragrant pool all day, eating iced fruit off silver trays and dreaming of a house with a red door, but a queen belongs to her people, not to herself. '""

Finally in Dany Chapter 10 of DWD She thinks of everything and everyone when she is lost in the wilderness with Drogon. On who has ever made her happy starting with Jorah and ending the thought with the house with the red door. Another clever move by GRRM that gives the reader away to associate one with the other but not overtly:

'""Ser Jorah had been with her then, her gruff old bear. She'd had Irri and Jhiqui and Doreah to care for her, her sun-and-stars to hold her in the night, his child growing inside her. Rhaego. I was going to name him Rhaego, and the dosh khaleen said he would be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Not since those half-remembered days in Braavos when she lived in the house with the red door had she been as happy.""ù

This concludes my section on Jorah = the red door/home in Dany's future as the next section showcases his involvement in Dany's future family. ",SPOILER
Several times in ASOIF characters are rumored to be interested in boys (off the top of my head i can think of Oberyn and that knight from the Vale) but what does that mean? Obviously pedophilia isnt a Westerosi concept but are they attracted to children or into young men/teenage boys? ,SPOILER
"In the Vale, we hear Catelyn recount the story of Alyssa Arryn who saw her brothers, husband and children killed in front of her but did not shed a tear. While this does seem to foreshadow Cat's becoming Lady Stoneheart, I thought that the theme seemed to resonant with Sansa's story as well.

In AGOT what Sansa' has been taught ladylike behavior is when Jeyne after her reaction to Ser Hugh of the Vale's death. 

> Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure 

Septa Mordan escorts Jeyne back to her room and claims she was not feeling well

We can see Sansa believes this as weel after Jeyne was put into Sansa's room following Ned's arrest and the massacre of the Northmen. While Sansa wept when she was in her room alone, she acted more composed once Jeyne was put in the room and again thought Jeyne childish at her continued weeping.

> '""I'm certain your father is well,""ù Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right. '""I'll ask the queen to let you see him.""ù She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne's spirits, but the other girl just looked at her with red, swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder. She was such a *child* 

Sansa's non-reactions to things that should cause her grief gained new motivation after her father's murder. When Joffrey took her to look at the heads of her father and their household, he wanted her to break down but she didn't want to give him the satisfaction and ""went away inside"" t

> He can make me look at the heads, she told herself, but he can't make me see them... The severed head had been dipped in tar to preserve it longer. Sansa looked at it calmly, not seeing it at all. It did not really look like Lord Eddard, she thought; it did not even look real. '""How long do I have to look?""ù  

While the reader understands Sansa's perspective, an outsider may would not necessarily know what she is thinking. I wonder if similar motivations stopped Alyssa from showing her grief but she has just been poorly remembered unjustly.

This theme is not as strong in later books but I wonder if Alyssa was abandoned foreshadowing of how Sansa would be remembered. As you know, in the original pitch letter Sansa was also originally intended to marry Joffrey and bear him a son. She would have heard of her brother(s) death(s) in a Lannister court and be forced to act as if she did not care or thought they deserved traitor's deaths as she did in ACOK and ASOS but she also would have had her husband and son killed in the original pitch (Jaime kills those above him in the line of succession) making her story closer to Alyssa's than even Cat's.",SPOILER
She seems to really dislike every other woman in Westeros but if she could pick someone for Joffrey or Tommen to marry who do you think it would be?,SPOILER
"Rhaegar has grandmothers from House Dayne, House Martell, and the Rogares' of Lys and thats only his lineage back to AegonIV. Now I am no genealogist but that makes him 12ish% Valyrian or Targaryan allowing some error for unknown intermarrying couples.",SPOILER
"Up from the moment Cat let Jaime on the loose with Brienne to Jaime getting back to King's Landing. Damn i enjoy it so much. The grudging respect they have for each other is awesome to read imo. They are so different yet so similar, both are belittled and shittalked behind their backs and they learn to understand each other with time. Maybe i'm a little bitch for love-hate relationships idk",SPOILER
"So i was running though all of Jon's dreams recently i found quit a few similarities to Dany's, they are almost like mirrored version of each other. Dany's dreams tend to get become more positive as time goes on, while Jon's become darker.

>And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It's black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don't want to. I'm afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it's not them I'm afraid of. I scream that I'm not a Stark, that this isn't my place, but it's no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. **It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream."" He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. ""That's when I always wake."" His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his cell. Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak.** He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf's shaggy white fur. ""Do you dream of Horn Hill?"" Jon asked.
>
>Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear. She ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. '""You woke the dragon,""ù he screamed as he kicked her. '""You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon.""ù Her thighs were slick with blood. She closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she looked again Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. **It turned its great head slowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a fine sweat.**

In the first set things seem much worse for Dany, the both wake up the same way.

>Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. In the dark he'd heard the scrape of stone on stone. When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror. He dared not go back to sleep. Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked, restless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the east. **It was only a dream. I am a brother of the Night's Watch now, not a frightened boy.**
>
>There was only her and the dragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood, Dany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her. She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. **She felt strong and new and fierce.**

This Next set is about the two of them trying to grow and become stronger, though Dany's dream becomes much more positive

>**He dreamt he was back in Winterfell, limping past the stone kings on their thrones. Their grey granite eyes turned to follow him as he passed, and their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted swords upon their laps. You are no Stark, he could hear them mutter, in heavy granite voices. There is no place for you here. Go away.** He walked deeper into the darkness. ""Father?"" he called. ""Bran? Rickon?"" No one answered. A chill wind was blowing on his neck. ""Uncle?"" he called. ""Uncle Benjen? Father? Please, Father, help me."" Up above he heard drums. They are feasting in the Great Hall, but I am not welcome there. I am no Stark, and this is not my place. His crutch slipped and he fell to his knees. The crypts were growing darker. A light has gone out somewhere. ""Ygritte?"" he whispered. ""Forgive me. Please."" But it was only a direwolf, grey and ghastly, spotted with blood, his golden eyes shining sadly through the dark.

>
>**Ghosts lined the hallway, dressed in the faded raiment of kings. In their hands were swords of pale fire. They had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white, and their eyes were opal and amethyst, tourmaline and jade. ""Faster,"" they cried, ""faster, faster."" She raced, her feet melting the stone wherever they touched. ""Faster!"" the ghosts cried as one,** and she screamed and threw herself forward. A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew.

In this sequence both Dreams have Stone ancestors, Dany ancestors cheer her on, Jon's ancestors refuse him.

I'm not sure what, this means but their is a definite link between the dreams.",SPOILER
"Okay no, not literally.

But now that I have your attention, let me explain: there are several similarities between the two characters.

1. They both come from these proud cultures of warriors and raiders, with lifestyles based around strength and taking things from others. The only difference being that the Dothraki ride horses while the Ironborn sail ships (though the Dothraki just see ships as wooden horses, interestingly enough.)

2. They are both products of their culture, and while deplorable by our standards, by the standards of their people they are actually great guys. They have just about every trait that their respective peoples consider admirable. They lead from the front, they are excellent warriors, and they will not tolerate any slight or insult against them.

3. They both seem to care about their wives. Yes, I know Victarion beat his most recent wife to death, but he cried while doing so, and I believe that it's implied that he only did it because it is what was required of him (product of his culture, and all that.) Meanwhile, Drogo appears to genuinely care for and be protective towards Dany.

4. They are both almost killed by a seemingly minor injury. Victarion gets a cut on his hand, while Drogo lost a nipple and a bit of skin. They refuse to seek proper treatment for their wounds, allowing them to fester to the point where only magic can save them. And it does, but for a price - Drogo is in a coma while Victarion's hand is blackened and charred.

5. They both free slaves on Dany's behalf. Dany decides she wants to take a bunch of innocent people under her protection and save them rape/enslavement, so she does, and Drogo allows it. Victarion hears that Dany is a liberator of slaves and a breaker of chains, so that's what he does (even if he does more or less force them to do the exact same thing they would have done as a slave anyway.)

6. Drogo vows to ride wooden horses across the Poison Waters to retake Daenerys's throne, while Victarion vows to sail across the Dothraki Sea in order to marry her. We never see Drogo strangle someone to death for laughing about how ships aren't horses, but I have a feeling that is something he would do.

-----

So, what does this mean for the story?

I think that, when Dany meets Victarion, these parallels will not go unnoticed. I do not think it will lead to her falling for him or marrying him, however. Rather, it will cause her to reflect on her past, come to the realization that her relationship with Khal Drogo wasn't as great as she thought it was, and then reject Victarion because she believes that's what marrying him will lead to.

As for what this means for Victarion, I don't know.",SPOILER
"Like how Victarion is '""The Iron Captain""ù or Aero is '""The Captain of the Guards""ù ",SPOILER
"I had a couple of questions regarding the in universe version of F&B vs. the irl version.
The version in the series is said to be so rare only the citadel has a full copy of it, and it's locked away. What makes it this secretive? Are both versions(irl and in universe) the same? Do you think because Tyrion seems to want it quite badly, that this could also be the book the fm are after? I think that it has the answers regarding Summerhall and the cause of its destruction, I just really hope that the answers will also be in the vol. 2 release. If the information from summerhall is in there do you believe that either the fm or Euron will use it to kill one of Dany's dragons? Or do you think maybe the information will be used to hatch the dragon egg he '""threw in the sea""ù?

Sorry about the rambling, I'm kind of trying to get a grasp on the theories regarding all of this. Also apologies for the format I'm on mobile.

Thanks for any answers.",SPOILER
"So one of the controversial changes made by the show was to have the Umbers betray the Starks and supporting the Boltons. This was viewed as wildly out of character for them, and I'd agree. However, the show has a habit of simplifying the events of the books. What if the Umbers do become antagonists in the books, but in a different context. The motivation the show gives for the betrayal is that Umbers are worried about the Wildlings coming South. This makes sense as they, along with the Mountain Clans, have a great deal of animosity with the Wildlings. There already was a scene where Brandon Norrey mets with Jon Snow and expresses concerns with the plan to settle the Wildlings south of the wall. Though it still doesn't make sense that they'd throw in with the Boltons. But what if instead of betraying House Stark as a whole, they just go to war with Jon and the Wildlings?

There have been many threads discussing the potential for a Stark Civil War. The general consensus is that Rickon and Sansa will both try to claim the Kingdom of the North. Some have suggested that Jon will leave the Watch after being resurrected and join in the conflict, just as in the show. Either he will side with one of his siblings or try to declare himself King. Either way, he will likely bring some Wildlings with him. If he does that, this will probably alienate the Umbers, who will declare against him. To me, this seems more likely than the Umbers joining with the Boltons. Also, given how bastards are looked down on, the Umbers won't feel like they're betraying the Starks. They'll probably see Jon as someone who's trying to take Winterfell from his true born siblings.

**TL;DR:** The Umbers won't betray the Starks and side with the Boltons, but they might go to war with Jon Snow over the Wildlings.",SPOILER
"Season 7 of the show dropped some pretty big hints that Dany and Jon will have a child. 

Unless they do a big flash forward, we will only see that child as a baby. Personally I can't see the ending being a '19 years later it's all fine and Eddard Rhaegar sits the throne' kinda deal.

So that got me thinking... what's the point of giving Dany a baby? 

It's obviously got to be important to the plot, or it would most likely have been cut out of the show. I was also thinking about the theories that Jon will sacrifice Dany (or vice versa) Nissa Nissa style to get Lightbrigher.

Could Dany will sacrifice her child in an attempt to become Azor Ahai? The theory fits with Jon as well, but Dany does have that whole slightly fire power mad thing going on, and Jon is too honourable.
It could also kickstart a war between Dany and Jon and obviously would be an important plot arc.

What do you think? Is there another reason the plot needs Dany and Jon to have a child?",SPOILER
"Ok, so I've been thinking. 

&#x200B;

What if the Long Night, Azor Ahai, and the last hero never happened. 

What if Bran had a vision about things that need to be done to save Planetos and he started influencing writers and singers to start making their legends so people would have an idea what is coming and what needs to be done. Hmm, showerthoughts, please forgive me :D ",SPOILER
"We know *very* little about House Tollett. We do know that they are allied with (though not signatory members) of the Lords Declarant. Most of which are quite closely tied with the Starks through blood or friendship. 

They are bannermen of Bronze Yohn's, who was one of Ned's closest friends. It's quite conceivable that the Tolletts would have met and may even have been close with Ned. 

Just as Edric seems to be a Dornish spin on the northern Eddard. I think Eddison is a Vale equivalent. ",SPOILER
"George hates the show, saying that he's too busy to watch and making catty jokes about it in F&B, and I'm guessing it's because of it's blatant ignorance of the world he's built.",SPOILER
"Can someone explain to me a bit about the timeline of how Aerys got killed?

Everybody in the AUDIENCE knows that Jaime stabbed Aerys in the back because he was acting extra crazy that day and had been shouting '""burn them all""ù for hours as rebel forces were about to sack the city. 

But what was the trigger for why Jaime did it *then*? Like what was the ticking bomb clock in the scene? Did Aerys tell his pyromancers to do something? Was Aerys on his way to the secret pathways with a torch?

Because it sounds like an old man with Alzheimer's was sitting in his comfy chair asking his caregiver something over and over, as people with diminished mental capacity are wont to do. '""Lock the doors! Lock the doors! Check the locks!""ù

If Jaime really killed Aerys to save the townspeople""îrather than to save himself, benefit his house or just to shut up the old man who was stressing everybody out""îshouldn't there be a clear instigating moment or imminent threat that could not be resolved in any other way than a knife in the back?",SPOILER
"Does anyone besides Melisandre talk about the extra potentcy of Kings blood?  I don't think so, but I haven't read all of the extended woiaf books yet.

I think she's wrong.  I don't think proclaiming yourself king suddenly makes your blood more magically powerful.  

There are bloodlines with inherent magic abilities, and some of them are/were Kings or claimants, like the Starks, Targaryens, and maybe the Greyjoys, and I think they might make blood magic more potent.  Mance Rayder won't, though.  He's just a charismatic leader in a time of crisis for the wildlings, and convinced them that together they were stronger.

There are also kingly families that don't necessarily have any magic associated with them, like most of south of the neck.  

And there are families, like the Reeds, that we're never kings (as far as I know) that clearly have magic in them.

Anyway, Melisandre is going to kill Shireen for nothing.",SPOILER
"For me, the most satisfying ever is Season 6 Episode 10, ""The Winds of Winter"", directed by the wonderful Miguel Sapochnik, when Cersei blows up the Sept; it's so poetic and entrancing. My second-favorite is Season 5 Episode 8 ""Hardhome"", when we first really realize how unstoppable the Army of the Dead is.

&#x200B;

My least favorite is Season 5 Episode 6 ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"", directed by the uneven Jeremy Podeswa, and I did not dislike it because of the bad rape scene. It's the dialogue, pacing, everything really, which is just cheesy. The second worst was Season 6 Episode 8 ""No One"", with Arya's Terminator-like chase and its utter lack of believability.",SPOILER

" In the books it seems like the prophecy about  The Prince who was Promised/Azor Ahai reborn is a lot more relavent to the endgame that he's headed towards. It really hasnt been mentioned in the show much at all since Stannis bit the dust. Melissandre just kinda mentions in passing that maybe she was wrong and maybe Jon Snow could be him instead. So what do yall think? Will the show address it before its all over and done with? I know GRRM has said that prophesies could be misread or not even be real.

 Anyways, the reason I'm asking is I feel like it could be Jon/Aegon and he's gonna have to forge another Lightbringer and temper it in Dany's chest like Azor Ahai did to Nissa Nissa. Feel free to rip my theory apart, i wanna be wrong. At the same time, I could kinda see something like that happening in the books but i feel they haven't really set it up on the show like he kinda has in the books ",SPOILER

Even the mud was icing up about the edges, Theon saw. ""Winter is coming..."" Rowan gave him a hard look. ""You have no right to mouth Lord Eddard's words. Not you. Not ever. After what you did""


This response from Rowan seems to suggest a deep loyalty/respect for the starks, but dont most/all Wildlings hate the Starks? It just feels misplaced, if Rowan was a northerner who Able brought into their conspiracy I would understand this reaction. But this is a Wildling, more than that she is a fierce Spearwife. Freshly defeated by the bastard son of ned. Why would she show this level of respect for the Stark family?

"Personally, I think Petyr Baelish would make a great king. He is cold and manipulative, but I think he would make a great ruler. Petyr isn't sadistic or cruel for the sake of it. He is very smart and cunning and (seemingly) wants the iron throne more than anything. He doesen't strike me as a person that would just waste his power on nothing like Robert. I personally think he would get reforms through, and get shit done. Things that needed to be done.  
  
He is by no means a morally upstanding person in any way. But I don't think he would just let the power be wasted away on nothing like Robert. Cersei for example would be the worst of queens, for the same reason as Robert. She just wants power for the sake of it and to elevate herself. She doesen't care about anyone. Improving the realm? Least of her concerns. It would be just as stagnant as with Robert. Nothing would change.  
  
  
But Petyr? I think he has the cold calculating logic to improve and better the realm for the people. Not out of kindness, but for practical reasons. I sincerely believe Petyr would be an excellent king purely for running the kingdom as a well oiled machine.  
   
Just wondering what your thoughts on him as a potential king is. Based on his personality how would his Westeros be any different (for better or worse) than other characters?",SPOILER
"People say this is a good possibility, but I see a couple of holes in it.

A. In his second attempt at tempering Lightbringer, Azor Ahai plunged his sword into a lion which was unsuccessful. When I think of a lion I think of a Lannister, but I don't recall Rhaegar killing a Lannister?

B. How could he be the song of ice and fire? His parents are both Targaryens.",SPOILER
"In re Kingsguard serving during the era covered by the five ASOIAF books published to date, we are meant to understand that both morally and martially, the best KG is Selmy, then Clegane, then Arys Oakheart. 

Mandon and Borros and Trant and the charming Kettleblacks are trash. 

Jaime committed adulterous treason which led to a second act of Jaime-centric Kingslaying so he's not even in contention for the list. (Sorry not sorry.)

I've given Arys third position because we are reading/experiencing a Stark-centric take on King's Landing during the Lannister era, and Arys is always relatively kind to Sansa.

When she is forced to marry Tyrion he brings her to the sept and tries to be encouraging and treats her with the same '""surprisingly gentle""ù touch as Sandor used to. In his POV chapters he regrets participating in her beatings although Sansa, for her part, credits him w going easy on her. 

We also know that the Lannisters hold him in high regard because he's the one they send away with Myrcella as her personal guardian. 

I've seen complaints about Arys Oakheart's POVs being pointless because Arianne Martell is an idiot etc. But I don't think the Arys POVs are just about the excitement of sex and death and the Dornish political subplot (namely low-key anti-Lannister revolutionaries), although those are fun aspects to the story. 

**I think Arys' chapters""îspecifically his foolhardy passion for a Dornish princess in violation of his oaths and his duty to the crown and to Myrcella""îare meant to be an alternate-universe insight into Sandor Clegane's thinking had the history of the era forked off along a different path. If Sansa, princess of the North, runs off with the Hound, derelict Kingsguard to Joffrey, on the night the Blackwater burns, the Hound rightly suffers exquisite self-loathing the whole way through, whether or not he ever actually beds the unmarried beauty with whom fate has paired him.**

And then, at some point, driven by pride, bloodlust and heartfelt passion for his lady, he gets his head lopped off, which is not only bad for the Hound (read: Arys/Kingsguard/warrior), but leaves Sansa (read: Arianne/high-born heiress/lady) in a significantly worse strategic position than when she started. 

Arys' point of view, IMHO, is a thinly veiled telling of how things would have gone poorly for Sandor Clegane if he ran off with a princess without taking into account the complex and deadly politics in which her fate was entangled.

Varys has a speech about this at some point. There's more to winning the game of thrones (and/or winning the hand of the lady fair) than being able to cut knots in half with a sword. The combat skills and bravery of a Kingsguard are exceptional and very important but war is a subset of politics and must be understood as such. 

Arys' internal monologue is also another illustration of how sex is a primary motivator of human behavior (see GRRM's famous Hobbit sex quote) but that's something he can't explore directly in re Sansa and Sandor because of the squicky age gap. 

**tl;dr: Arys and Arianne's plot is a GRRM-penned SanSan cautionary-tale fanfic set in a post-Blackwater alternative universe.**",SPOILER
"The more I think about it, the more it seems right that Lyanna was in the Crypts of Winterfell during Robert's Rebellion.  It fits Rhaegar being the next Bael the Bard.  He plays the harp and says he is going to steal the daughter of the lord of Winterfell.  But, the last guy who did that hid the lady in the crypts until she gave birth.  So, why are we assuming that Lyanna ever left Winterfell?

&#x200B;

We do have people gossiping that she was stolen away, yet don't have any eye witnesses.  So, that's not proof.

&#x200B;

We also have Ned's fever dream. However, the only thing we know about the fever dream is that our author said that its not to be relied upon.  For one it was probably sent by someone, so it may not have been Ned's memories.  Two, it contained two scenes (the battle and then finding Lyanna), yet we don't know how far apart they are.  If those are Ned's memories, then they could be memories that are 9 months apart.  George did say to not trust the dream, so why does everyone trust the dream?

"Why, if Cersei is trying to hide the huge secret that Joffrey is 100% Lannister, does she allow him to identify so hugely with the Lannisters? She makes sure to keep Jaime away from him but covers him in crimson and gold, lions etc. 

Secondly, did Tywin pay ANY attention to how his grandson was being raised and how he was turning out? He seems surprised by Joffrey when we finally see the two together. ",SPOILER

Most of the deaths aren't actually that brutal, especially with how numb most people are to death considering it's in almost every popular tv show.",SPOILER
"For those of you who haven't heard of this theory or simply forgot, basically the show (and the books?) was hinting for a while that there was more to Tyrion than meets the eye...

There are a few key points to sum up the theory that Tyrion may very well be a Targaryen:

1. The hatred Tywin has towards him is unnaturally strong, stronger than you could expect towards his own child (even given his reasons). Perhaps his wife had Tyrion with another man (a Targaryen).
2. Tyrion's mother died during child birth, the same happened with Daenerys and Jon, both of which we know are Targaryens. A pattern developing here?
3. Tyrion was able to approach the dragons in the crypt and they were accepting of him just as they were to Jon on the cliff side. The only three characters we've ever seen this with are yet again Daenerys, Jon and Tyrion.
4. ""The dragon has three heads, three dragon riders, blah blah..."" Basically, it is believed that there must be one rider for each of the three dragons. There was always Daenerys, then eventually Jon, leaving a need for one more (seems they all need to be Targaryens).
5. Very possible that the story of Aerys (the Mad King) taking Tywins wife for a night is true and this could have been when Tyrion was conceived. *Thanks to /u/abc0802 for reminding me of this information.*

Anyway, all of those points strongly suggested that Tyrion may be half Lannister half Targaryen (or some combination of the two). 

**BUT, after the loss of Viserion, there are now just 2 dragons remaining on the side of the living leaving no real need for a third rider; that or the Night King is now the third rider. Either way, should we see either of these possibilities as a sign that the show is telling us Tyrion is in fact just a Lannister and Tywin really does hate him that much even though they are blood related?**",SPOILER
"As soon as they hear about the Wall being destroyed and that the Night King has resurrected Viserion and flying all over the North burning down house after house on their way to Winterfell do you think that Daenerys will just patiently stand still and wait for the dead to come to her. In the later seasons we have seen a more aggressive side of her so why should this change now.  


I believe she will refuse the advice of the other men at Winterfell and take both of her dragons to go and look for Viserion and ""end the battle before it begins"" with Daenerys gone this would also be the perfect chance for Bran to reveal to Jon his true heritage.   


After Daenerys sees yet another house burnt to a crisp she comes to the army of the dead and starts burning them. After a short while Daenerys sees the blue flames of Viserion hit Rhaegal, Rhaegal falls from the sky and lands on the ground, At this moment thousands of wrights jump on Rhaegal piercing the flesh of the beast. Daenerys realizing she has made a terrible decision quickly flys back to Winterfell .  


Back at Winterfell after the news has broken about Jons true hertiage and that Daenerys mistaken could have just lost them the war she starts to lose the support of some of her most loyal followers and perhaps even her army, Drogon now the last remaining dragon will no longer follow the orders of Daenerys who flies away just as soon as the Dead have reached the gates of Winterfell.  


As Daenerys is now a liability on the battlefield she is brought down to the crypts of Winterfell with a few other non essential personnel, Whilst all the fighting is happening on the outside Daenerys realizes that without the support of her followers and now that she is no longer the last living Targaryen she runs out of Winterfell through one of the hidden passages as she begins her search for Drogon, This will be the last time we see Daenerys for quite some time.

 

After the battle of Winterfell is over the remaining survivors look for Daenerys when they are unable to find her they believe that she was killed in the battle, they turn their attention to Jon as now he is the true heir to the iron throne, After a heated discussion Jon understands that its in his best interest to now pursue the iron throne as Jon now holds command of the remaining  survivors of the Unsullied, The Northern Army,  Wildlings and perhaps the Dorthraki, Perhaps Tyrion has convinced the Dorthraki and the Unsullied to avenge their queen by fighting for Jon remember they all believe she has died in the war.  


After the battle of Kings Landing with the Golden Company and Lannister soldiers vs Unsullied, North Army, Wildlings, Dorthraki and Cersei is killed Jon looks to resume his place on the Iron Throne as he goes to walk towards the Iron Throne, Daenerys comes flying through the throne room with Drogon, Daenerys goes on a rant about how she has been betrayed by everyone and after being away for so long she realizes that her father was right and she should ""Burn them All"" as she turns to Drogon she begins to scream the word Dracarys but before she could finish Jon drives his sword in the back of Daenerys killing her, Drogon turns around and burns Jon alive.   


Throne room now nearly burnt to a crisp both Daenerys and Jon dead at the bottom of the Iron Throne, A discussion is hold as the remaining survivors discuss who should sit on the Iron Throne, There are only 3 legitimate chances to sit on the throne, Sansa, Gendry and Tyrion. Sansa decides its best for her to honor her ancestors and return back to Winterfell where she will look to rebuild her families legacy, Which then leaves 2, Gendry decides that after he has witnessed what having power can do to you he declines the opportunity to sit on the throne which leaves Tyrion to become King Tyrion.  


You get your bittersweet ending with Tyrion on the throne and both Jon and Daenerys dead.",SPOILER
"If you were cersei would you have attempted to assassinate Dany?

I would have. My reasoning: I don't believe in magic or the gods (She blew up a sept remember).

So rig up the dragon pit with wildfire and concoct a plan to set it off while she's there to cut the head off the snake",SPOILER
"John snow becoming the night king to me seems like it's the only way to defeat to cersei. Dany and her army will see a loss of numbers since their is going to be a big battle in episode 3 supposedly. The knights of the vale are at winterfell currently meaning they will most likely get slaughtered as well. Cersei will not join the fight. She will most likely be gearing up to defeat the rest of danys retreating forces. Cersei will have the Golden companies army and eurons. Which have no losses. Lannisters are on danys side. Which means the only army capable of taking cersei on would be the night kings army. They are 100k strong and only defeatable via fire and dragon glass, something cersei doesn't have. Another way cersei can get defeated would be via eurons death. If REE... Theon can kill him. Eurons army will most likely be led by theons sister. Meaning cersei will have only the Golden company at her disposal. But the Golden company does state that they favor statics not bets. Meaning they will most likely pull out of her power. Making cersei powerless. We haven't seen the unsullied so that could potentially play a role but idk how I would fit them. John becoming the night king to defeat the true evil is bitter sweet imo. Cersei having a change of heart can dismantle this whole theory  though. Thoughts? ",SPOILER
I was rewatching my favorite scene in the show: Jon executing Janos Slynt in 5x3 and it made me wonder if Tyrion or Jon has any idea of the other's role in Janos's fate. Meaning if Tyrion knows that Jon executed Janos or if Jon knows that Tyrion sent Janos to the wall.,SPOILER
"TMFG selected Arya to a final purpose, that's why she was trained and let go by the FM. 

Additionally, the revival of Jon Snow is tied to the fate of Stannis, what are the odds that a priestess of Ashai was in the wall in the exact moment Jon was stabbed. 

The final purpose is that the living must win so they keep dying. A world without death, even if they rule the world is not what the balance should be. ",SPOILER
"So is the Lord of Light the god that is actually real in the game of thrones universe? Since we've seen him bring back Jon Snow and Beric Dondarrion (many times). Also, Melisandre's blood magic seemed to work when she threw the three leeches into the fire and called the usurpers' names. They're all dead now. Is the Lord of Light/The Red God the true deity?? And the Seven aren't?",SPOILER
"Oh my gosh this episode is intense. You have Cersei blowing up the sept of Baelor with wild fire. The killing of Grand Maester Pycelle. And Tommen committing suicide. And then you have Ser Davos confronting Melisandre about the death of Princess Shireen. (Which made me cry, because Davos truly loved her). And then Jon Snow birth mother was revealed. And he was claimed the King of the North. Dany sails for Westeros. And then Dany named Tyrion her hand. I mean this episode was intense, and it was so good. I am shocked by this season 6 finale. ",SPOILER
"When Mirri Maz Duur tells Daenerys that the blood magic spell requires a death to save a life, Daenerys thinks she is saying she will need to die. Mirri Maz Duur says no, not her life, pauses, and then says to bring Drogo's horse. During that pause she looks down and is clearly looking at Dany's pregnant belly. She gives her intentions away to the audience the moment the question is asked. Nothing big, and I'm not sure if it's been posted before, but I thought it was a cool direction for the actress to take. ",SPOILER
"I am currently rewatching all the seasons in preparation for the final season. When Rob Stark first crossed the Twins, I was under the impression that the Frey army joined him with the exception of 400 men to hold the crossing. In Season 3 after Rob loses the Karstark men he says that the only army who hasn't sworn for one side or another is the Freys, which is why he heads back to the Twins before the Red Wedding. Its been a while since I read the books.",SPOILER
"Bran has a huge role to play in season 8, but hes done nothing but get people killed and confirm Jon's parentage (which Howland Reed couldve likely done). What could he possibly do to stop the white walkers and redeem himself from being a liability for 67 episodes? 

Here's my guess: he goes inside Jon's mind and forces him to kill Daenerys. Jon will never kill her willingly, and only Bran will know that the Azor Ahai prophecy is true when he sees back in time and watches the man himself. What are the other theories on how he will stop the army of the dead?",SPOILER
I really want to see what he looks like now under his helmet. Hopefully we get to see in Season 8.,SPOILER
"I know the episode where they take his last baby and turn him, but what is their reasoning and what's the long game?

I don't have a clue, but I guess they might be future white walkers kept beyond the wall as a back up plan if the Night King fails. 

They can't fight now they maybe in another 1000 years they will be ready. ",SPOILER
"I don't think this has ever been clarified in the show. After Tywin's death, who became Lord or Lady of Casterly Rock? Also, who holds the title now?

To my understanding, Tyrion as Tywin's secondborn son and only eligible heir became Lord of Casterly Rock after Tywin's death. However, Tyrion went into exile and never assumed the role.

Jaime was in the King's Guard at the time, so he is ruled out.

Did Cersei become Lady of Casterly Rock upon Tywin's death? If so, who ruled over the Rock while she was imprisoned by the High Sparrow? Did Kevan rule it in her stead?

Was Jaime named Lord of Casterly Rock ofscreen, as he is seen commanding the Lannister armies in season 7, after he was removed from the King's Guard?

Any thoughts?",SPOILER
"So I'm watching the show for the first time and I just finished season six, and I came to think of something: Am I the only one who thinks Loras Tyrell deserved so much better? He spent his last days locked in a cell before confessing to his ""crimes"", for then to get basically tortured by the sparrows. All this just to die in Cercei Lannisters wildfire attack moments after. I realize Loras might not have been the most likeable character, but it's still kind of sad to me, considering his potential to play a big role in ""wars to come"", not to mention his potential to grow as a person and become more likeable. Does anyone agree with me? Are there any other characters you thought deserved better?",SPOILER
"Now I know everyone loves to talk about Hardhome and Battle of the Bastards.

Which episodes do you think are the most underrated.

I feel like Watchers on the Wall is one of them, thoughts?",SPOILER
"It is taken as gospel that it refers to Targaryens. However, the original prophecy from the wood witch spoke of only The Prince That Was Promised that would be born from the Aerys II-Rhaella line. Whether it refers to a man or a woman, it refers to only one person from that line.

&#x200B;

Rhaegar was so obsessed with the prophecy that he felt he needed to name his children Rhaenys, Aegon and Visenya. He felt Aegon alone wouldn't be able to fulfil the prophecy, that he needed two sisters to help him, like Aegon the Conqueror. Obviously, that didn't work out with Elia Martell giving birth to only Rhaenys and Aegon and so he went to Lyanna, hoping she would give birth to Visenya. That also didn't pan out. Instead, we got another Aegon, and Elia's children died.

&#x200B;

So now most people are speculating that the three heads are three of the following choices: Dany, Jon, Tyrion, Night King, Jaime, Bran. But Rhaegar never considered that the dragon's three heads refers to three random Targaryens, he needed them to be siblings. So much so that he married Lyanna, triggering a war, to ensure there would be a Visenya. Why go to all that trouble? Because Rhaegar felt the bond of family would be the strongest and help Aegon. By Rhaegar's logic, the above choices wouldn't be good enough. Pick any trio and they wouldn't have a strong enough bond like the original Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys.

&#x200B;

So which three characters, preferably siblings, preferably one boy with two sisters, do we know that fit Rhaegar's vision?  


Jon, Arya and Sansa. We know Jon is Aegon. The only ""sisters"" he has are Arya and Sansa. If we are to take Bran at his word that he's just the Three-Eyed Raven now, then that becomes even more poignant. I'm not saying Arya and Sansa are secret Targaryens or will ride dragons or will marry Jon. But the idea of 'the dragon must have three heads' is not unlike 'the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives'. The fact that Dany has/had three dragons is irrelevant; it's about family and unity, not actual dragons. Jon might be the Prince That Was Promised, but he needs his sisters. Arya, like her idol Visenya, is a warrior who dabbles in dark arts and is skilled with a sword. Sansa, like Rhaenys, is more lady-like and understands diplomacy. When the truth about Jon is revealed, you can bet Sansa and Arya will stand beside Jon. The last teaser seemed to highlight the importance of this trio in the final season as well.

  
And let's not forget when Tywin spoke to Arya about Aegon and his feats, Arya countered him, saying, ""Aegon and his sisters. It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya too.""

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 'The dragon must have three heads' refers to family and unity, and thus refers to Jon, Arya and Sansa.",SPOILER
"IMO, Cleganebowl wont happen. ""The Hound"" was slowly dying throughout his journy with Arya and he finally died when he lost to Brienne (of fucking tarth) and is now just Sandor. Arya will probably kill the mountain because she has the speed advantage and it is foreshadowed by her list. Sandors character arc has gone from a dog who is filled with hate to a man who is passionate deep down and wants to redeem himself, it would be stupid to revert him back to his hatrid. When he says you know whats coming for you at the dragon pit to the mountain hes probably just talking about death, or he may even be inferring that the mountain will die by fire, perhaps beric will kill him with his flaming sword as him and sandor are somewhat mates now",SPOILER
"During the Battle of Blackwater, Stannis attacks the Mud Gate. After Stannis pushes back the first Lannister foray, Tyrion leads men through a sewer that comes out on the beach near the wall, not far from Stannis. It may be the way it was filmed, but it looked like the sewer was a few dozen yards away from the gate.

I assume Stannis didn't know about it, but imagine if he did...all that would have stood between his legions and King's Landing was a rusty lock. It bothers me to think about it. A wide open sewer right on the wall that is so easy to get into.

All he would need is 20 good men to get in to cause enough chaos to turn the tide.",SPOILER
"At S05E07 Maester Aemon says ""Egg laughs like that"" while talking about Gilly's son Sam. ""Egg"" he meant was Aegon Targeryan. It could be a foreshadow about Gilly's son become the King who was promised.",SPOILER
So I'm rewatching the series and noticed that anyone who wasn't at Castle Black doesn't know about Jon's murder. Yet no one (aside from Tyrion) asks how he became King in the North if he already swore an oath to the Night's Watch. The northerners just crowned him King without anyone raising suspicion as to what happened. Why is no one asking? ,SPOILER
"The first 4 seasons, he was great. We see how he is, we learn why with Tywin and all. S2 he has the rise to power and falls. S3 he suffers, S4 he's fed up and the speech and killing Tywin are so satisfying. I guess 5 was decent, somewhat of a transition period. 

But 6 and 7 have just been disappointing. He's a glorified advisor really, always in Dany's shadow and in 7 his plans were just stupid. I wanted to see him actually do something remarkable, like the blackwater and the build up to it. 

It would have been so satisfying after everything he's been through for him to succeed and make a name for himself. Instead we get this and in S7 his battle plans totally fail just so Cersei can look badass.  

Look Ik he's not a king or anything and I don't expect that. But it sucks so much to see him become a supporting character that makes funny jokes and advises. He could be so much more. ",SPOILER
"Although Cersei is a formidable opponent and one that has survived seven seasons, I would argue is not the best at winning the iron throne. I feel if you were to take her character and start her were someone like Varys or Littlefinger started (basically from not much) she would have been dead a long time ago. What do you guys think? Who is this best at playing the game for the iron throne?",SPOILER
"Dany wore the same outfit for the KL meeting as she wore during the battle in episode 4. She was probably ready to ""burn them all"" in case Tyrion's ""clever plan"" wouldn't work.

"After watching through the series again (in preparation for season 8, of course), I realized that a lot of Uncle Benjen's time beyond the Wall is mostly unaccounted for. As someone who's only seen the TV series, I'm not sure if it's really covered in the books, but I think it could make for a very interesting spinoff game. 

Imagine a '""Shadow of Mordor""ù type game where you play as Benjen during his time beyond the Wall, just cracking skulls with a flaming flail and stacking white-walker bodies a mile high, culminating in an epic, one vs. all battle after you save Jon Snow. That would be the most metal shit I've ever played in my life. ",SPOILER
"\[Spoiler\] I hope some of you can explain this to me because im a bit confused by it. So according to some lore Videos, the Nightking was once a Man of the Nightwatch until he met a Witch and fell in Love with her and so on but in the Series we have a Scene where the Children of the Forest ""create"" the first White Walker. So if its true that the Nightking really was a Man of the Nightwatch. Who is the Guy that they made to be the first White Walker, do we know where he is today and is he still ""alive""?",SPOILER
"When Danni enters the House of the Undying to find her dragons at the end of S2 she sees some things. One of the first things she sees is the Iron Throne as she stands in what appears to be King's Landing. It's deserted and kinda ashy/foggy. Above her the roof is scorched away. We had just learned a few episodes back that only dragon's fire can melt stone.
A bit of foreshadowing to what we'll see in S8??
",SPOILER
"I know the night king is just for the show, and I know the night's king was the 13th commander of the nights watch. The great other is supposed to be the antithesis to r'hllor, the god of light, so is it possible the Great Other is the books version of the shows Night King set to debut in TWOW 

Other as in the Others, Great as in ""leader of""",SPOILER
"If Littlefinger was the mastermind behind the whole war for the throne starting, how did he anticipate that Joffrey would go against Cersei's advice and kill Ned? Or would it have been the same outcome with Ned being sent to the wall? ",SPOILER
"Felt surreal. Dreamt that Viserion, the now ice dragon, killed and burnt Drogon and Rhaegal for some reason. The environment looked very humid though, felt like Dorne or the place where The Spoils of War happened.

Can't wait but I don't want it to end simultaneously. This is just a personal account of what I dreamt about so apologies if you dont care.",SPOILER
"Currently rewatching in time for season 8, and I noticed a small detail in episode 7. When Jorah approaches Quaithe in regards to Danys missing dragons, she is putting some form of a blessing on a sailor who is said to be travelling through Old Valyria. She says, ""All who pass through Old Valyria must carry protection"". Perhaps a small foreshadow to him getting greyscale later on in the show? Found it to be pretty interesting anyway! ",SPOILER
"She's going to bring some people back from the dead, Dany, maybe? That would help her regain Jon Snow's trust. I'm sure they're going to meet again somehow",SPOILER
"I just rewatched Littlefinger's trial & execution, & I really want to know what was going through Bronze Yohn Royce's mind. Or even the minds of any of the guards there. How did they accept what Bran said and Arya. They know none of the three were witnesses. Do they know about Bran and the three eyed raven? Were the Northerners like ""yep, people have visions. That's the old gods."" And just totally on board? Were they like ""dang! Sansa is bad@$$!""  I need to find that fan fiction that is probably out there. ",SPOILER
warg into the night king and commit suicide as the night king which will result in the night king and bran both dying.,SPOILER
"Wouldn't it have been easier for Jon to get a proof wight if he just took some prisoner into the woods beyond the wall, killed him and waited until he turned? This would've prevented some major problems haha",SPOILER
"Here are my thoughts.

8x01: Winter is Here

Rather obvious, and also a callback to the Pilot episode, which is fitting since this is the first episode of the last season. It begins immediately where the last left off and it sets up the fight against the Dead.

8x02: The Long Night

The majority of the fight against the Dead. It ends right on the climax and when things look the most grimm for the living.

8x03: Others

A long overdue backstory episode, one that will also set up the prequel spinoff.

8x04: A Dream of Spring

The conclusion of the fight against the Dead. It ends on a hopeful note, but then...

8x05: The Dwarf, the Cripple and the Mother of Madness

Echoing Tyrion's quote from an earlier season, it's a fitting title to conclude the fight against the series' longest running human antagonist, now that the longest running supernatural antagonist has been dealt with. A Lannister centric, maybe with some flashbacks from their childhood if necessary.

8x06: A Song of Ice and Fire

The epic conclusion!

What do you guys think? How do these sound? Likely? Unlikely? Corny and/or stupid? What would you choose and why? Let me know!",SPOILER
Rewatching the show just finished season 6 and I'm a little confused how Dany got the ships to cross the sea. I know she worked with Theon but did she agree to marry his uncle? Then is Theon also working with his uncle? Or did they get the ships another way?,SPOILER
"* **JAIME AS HAND OF THE KING**

&nbsp;


As many of you know, I am a huge supporter of the Theory that Jaime will be Hand of the King, for King Jon (still not sure what name he is going to choose). So, I decided to make a little selection of all the scenes that foreshadowed Jaime being Hand on season 1, which was the season that made me really pay attention to this idea. 

&nbsp;

On season one we were literally told by Tyrion Lannister on episode 1, that Jaime was the handsome brother and that Tyrion was the smart one. That of course, its not a lie, but I do think it was a way for books and show to deceives us, to overestimate Tyrion's intelligence and underestimate Jaime's capability as a leader and as a judge of human character. 

&nbsp;

* **SEASON 1 EPISODE 1**

>Cersei Lannister: **'""You should be Hand of the King""ù**

>Jaime Lannister: '""That's a honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.""ù

&nbsp;


In his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days. Remember Jaime always uses jokes to deflect insecurance or frustration. I actually think he likes the idea. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>Jaime (to Tyrion): Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. **Don't leave alone with these people.**

&nbsp;

When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. '""The Starks are feasting us this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people""ù. This was the QUOTE that got my attention. For some reason this line was shinning like a big foreshadowing to me. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **SEASON 1 EPISODE 2**

&nbsp;

>Jaime (to Jon Snow): '""Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.

&nbsp;

On episode 2, we have Jaime taking Jon right hand and thanking him for taking the black and joining the Nights Watch. They even make sure to pan the camera on Jaime taking Jon's hand.


&nbsp;

>Jaime Lannister : '""Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.""ù

>Eddard Stark: '""Glad to see you're protecting the throne.""ù

>Jaime Lannister : '""Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, **I wonder? What's the line ? The King shits and the Hand wipes.**

&nbsp;
 

When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King '""how do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it? Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.

&nbsp;

>CERSEI: '""I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.""ù

>CERSEI: **'""Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.""ù**

>KING ROBERT: '""I suppose this is where **you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.""ù**

&nbsp;

In the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.

&nbsp;

>Robert Baratheon: '""Seven hells! don't start with her again. The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, **I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.""ù**

&nbsp;

Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **SEASON 1 EPISODE 7**

&nbsp;

>Tywin Lannister (to Jaime): '""You're blessed with abilities that few men possess. You're blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the Kingdoms, and you're still blessed with youth. And what have you done with these blessings? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings, one a madman, the other a drunk. The future of our family will be determined in these next few months. We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years...or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did. **I need you to become the man you were always meant to be. Not next year, not tomorrow...now.**

&nbsp;

Finally, on episode 7 when Tywin Lannister is later introduced to the story. In this scene  he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. And that for me it will be Jaime arc on season 8. 

&nbsp;

Jaime completely outsmarted Tyrion in season 7 using the mistakes he made in the past as a lesson. Jaime and Jon were literally the two leaders on season 7 trying to save their people from unecessary deaths. He went to Cersei to tells her that they couldnt win against Dragons, he wanted her to surrender to Dany to save the lives of his armies and his people; he decided to abandon her to go fight North and save the realm. Finally free from Cersei, going North to help the Starks and fight for the realm Jaime is finally becoming the man he was supposed to be.

* **Foreshadowing from the books...**

&nbsp;


Now u/fedonciadale found several of foreshadow of this theory from the books and it's a remarkable work. I want to share just a small part here.  In the books it is not a pin, but a chain of hands that signifies the office of the hand.And the mummers make a rope and hang Jaime's hand around his neck like a chain.

&nbsp;


>Bolton's silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoat's slobbering malevolence. Pale as morning mist, his eyes concealed more than they told. Jaime misliked those eyes. They reminded him of the day at King's Landing when Ned Stark had found him seated on the Iron Throne. The Lord of the Dreadfort finally pursed his lips and said, **'""You have lost a hand.""ù**

>""No,'"" said Jaime, '""I have it here, hanging round my neck.""ù

>(ASOS, Jaime IV)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **Jaime acting like his father**

&nbsp;


Finally, we have Jaime actually starting to show signs that he could one day, became the man he father always hoped he could be.

&nbsp;


>The queen forced a smile and made pleasant noises. But when Tyrell had taken his leave and Tommen had been sent off with Ser Addam Marbrand, she turned on Jaime angrily. **'""Are you drunk or dreaming, ser? Pray tell, why am I having supper with that grasping fool and his puerile wife?""ù** A gust of wind stirred her golden hair. '""I will not name him Hand, if that's what""î""ù

>**'""You need Tyrell,""ù** Jaime broke in, **'""but not here. Ask him to capture Storm's End for Tommen. Flatter him, and tell him you need him in the field, to replace Father. Mace fancies himself a mighty warrior. Either he will deliver Storm's End to you, or he will muck it up and look a fool. Either way, you win.""ù**

>**'""Storm's End?""ù** Cersei looked thoughtful. **'""Yes, but... Lord Tyrell has made it tediously plain that he will not leave King's Landing till Tommen marries Margaery.""ù**

>Jaime sighed. **'""Then let them wed. It will be years before Tommen is old enough to consummate the marriage.** And until he does, the union can always be set aside. **Give Tyrell his wedding and send him off to play at war.""ù**

>A wary smile crept across his sister's face. **'""Even sieges have their dangers,""ù** she murmured. **'""Why, our Lord of Highgarden might even lose his life in such a venture.""ù**

>**'""There is that risk,""ù** conceded Jaime. **'""Especially if his patience runs thin this time, and he elects to storm the gate.""ù**

>Cersei gave him a lingering look. '""You know,""ù she said, **'""for a moment you sounded quite like Father.""ù**

>(Jaime, AFFC)

&nbsp;

So, this is my theory. I really believe Jaime will be the Hand of the King on the end of this story.


",SPOILER
"The romance and future marriage between Jon Snow and Sansa Stark has been foreshadowed pretty much since book 1.

&nbsp;

* **YOU WILL MARRY A KING""¶""¶**

&nbsp;

>'""You,""ù Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, '""will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.""ù Arya screwed up her face. **""No,"" she said, ""that's Sansa.""** 

>(Eddard V- A Game of Thrones)

&nbsp;

For me this quote is one of the most important quotes from the entire series because it pretty much sets up for the audience both Sansa and Arya story arc. Sansa will be the sister who will marry and have children and fulfill her childhood dreams of a happy family, which is why Love, marriage and children will be a constant theme in Sansa's arc story. She will be treated as an object, passed around by the powerful players of the story, all interested in her claim of Winterfell and the North; she will be forced into marriage alliances and her future children will be desired for their claim in the North. Sansa will try to survive as much as she can, keeping still a slim hope to find love and happiness and maybe one day fulfill that sweet dream of a rebuilding her destroyed family.

Arya will follow another path; she will be a warrior and ruler on her own. Arya always wanted to be the keeper of her own holdfast, she wanted to be a knight and fight in battle and most important, I believe Arya wanted to feel the independence that most women in Westeros could never feel. Not that love and marriage is not impossible for her, but I feel George wants Arya to be a Queen regent on her own.

George is trying to tells us in this passage of the books that women should be able to choose their own paths and if its love, marriage and children what they wish for they should have it, but if its not, they should be free to figure out her own destiny. The tragedy of Lyanna Stark was that she never had a choice and was forced into marry someone she never cared for, and I believe George wants to show with both Sansa and Arya that girls should be free to choose their own dreams., because BOTH dreams are equality valid.

>When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. **She found his cloak on the floor**, twisted up tight, **the white wool stained with blood and fire.** The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.

>(A Clash of Kings - Sansa VII)

&nbsp;

Sansa cloaked herself with a cloak stained in ""Fire and Blood"" the words of House Targaryen. For me this has always been one of the biggest foreshadows on the book and its interesting to notice how George used the character of Sandor Cleagane as a redherring for this scene in order to not make so obvious the connection with Jon.

It was only when tumblr user occupyvenus made the connection of this particular scene with one that happened a few chapters before In the book A CLASH OF KINGS that it became pretty obvious this quote was about Jon Snow.

&nbsp;

* In the first book A GAME OF THRONES, chapter 4 Eddard I, we have King Robert arriving at Winterfell and asking to visit Lyanna tomb in the crypts of the castle. While there King Robert decides to ask for Sansa's hand in marriage for his son prince Joffrey. This is the chapter where Sansa and Joffrey become officially betrothed to each other and their Royal engagement its made official. The very next chapter? **JON**. This is also the chapter where Jon Snow will get drunk in the Feats for the king and ask uncle Ben to join the NightsWatch. 

&nbsp;


* In a CLASH OF KINGS chapter 52, SANSA IV, Sansa will get her period and be finally '""fit to bear children to the king""ù. Cersei then tries, as best as she can, to be a mother figure to Sansa in this very special moment and gives her a womanly advice. She tells her that love is a dangerous feeling that makes us all weaker and it should wiser for her to love only her children. Once again we have a chapter discussing Sansa future marriage to a king and the following chapter is **JON VII.**

&nbsp;



* Finally on A STORM OF SWORDS, we have the famous chapter 68, Sansa VI, where she laments that no one will ever marry her for love, its only her name and Winterfell they all want.  The very next chapter of the book? **JON**. Again, thats not a coincidence, George does this, he said that he takes a lot of planning and caring about the way he writes and structures his books.

&nbsp;

* **THEIR ROMANCE HAS ALSO BEEN VERY CAREFULLY FORESHADOWED BUT IN A VERY HIDDEN WAY. WHICH MAKES EVEN MORE INTERESTING FOR ME""¶""¶**


**A CLASH OF KINGS ""ì THE WINTER ROSE**

In A CLASH OF KINGS we will have George very quietly making the connection with Jon, Sansa and the tale of Bael the Bard.  While was I re reading the books I noticed that George was playing with the chapters orders and trying to tells us some hints of the story by putting characters chpaters next to each other. The first time Jon meets Ygritte on '""A CLASH OF KINGS""ù, chapter 51, she tells him a story of Bael the Bard and the Blue Winter Rose:

&nbsp;


>""The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael's head, but never could take him, and the taste o' failure galled him. One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak. When word o' that got back, Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson. So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and walked into Winterfell one winter's night with harp in hand, naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos. Sygerrik means 'deceiver' in the Old Tongue, that the First Men spoke, and the giants still speak.

>""North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark's own table, and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone. The old songs he played, and new ones he'd made himself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered to let him name his own reward. **'All I ask is a flower,' Bael answered, 'the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o' Winterfell.'**

>""Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. **So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o' the winter roses be plucked for the singer's payment.** And so it was done. But when morning come, the singer had vanished . . . and so had Lord Brandon's maiden daughter. **Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain.""**

>(A Clash of Kings ""ì Jon VI)

&nbsp;

Right next in the following chapter 52, Sansa has her first flowering. This is the chapter where Sansa gets her first period and its now **'""fit to bear children to the King.""ù**

&nbsp;



>""The blood is the seal of your womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. You've had your first flowering, no more."" Sansa had never felt less flowery. ""My lady mother told me, but I... I thought it would be different.""""Different how?""""I don't know. Less... less messy, and more magical.""ù Queen Cersei laughed. ""Wait until you birth a child, Sansa. A woman's life is nine parts mess to one part magic, you'll learn that soon enough... and the parts that look like magic often turn out to be messiest of all."" She took a sip of milk. ""So now you are a woman. Do you have the least idea of what that means?"" ""It means that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,"" said Sansa, ""and to bear children for the king."" ""¶""¶.
Do you want to be loved, Sansa?"" ""Everyone wants to be loved."" ""I see flowering hasn't made you any brighter,"" said Cersei. ""Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.""

>(A Clash of Kings ""ì Sansa IV)

&nbsp;


After getting her period for the first time and be finally ready to bear children for the king, Sansa is taken to see Cersei (on chapter 52) who uses the moment to give Sansa womanly advice about love. She warns her that she will probably never receive the love and attention from Joffrey, that she used to dream of.  She warns Sansa that love is dangerous and make us weaker. The following chapter of the book is **JON VII.**

&nbsp;

>'""Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. Do you want to be loved, Sansa?""ù '""Everyone wants to be loved.""ù **'""I see flowering hasn't made you any brighter,""ù** said Cersei. '""Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.""ù

>(A Clash of Kings ""ì Sansa IV)

&nbsp;

In the end of chapter Cersei warns Sansa about love and how dangerous it can be. The following chapter of the book is also **JON VII**. George really wanted us to picture Jon, Sansa and the Blue Winter Rose tale all together. For me this is one of the biggest clues that not only Jon and Sansa will marry but also, its their child that will continue House Stark.

&nbsp;

* **A STORM OF SWORDS ""ì THE FALLING SNOW**

&nbsp;

In A storm of Swords, George used the prologue of the book to foreshadow Jon and Sansa romance, using the snow to symbolize Jon Snow. In the two paragraphs under, Chett will lament that heavy snow has ruined his plans for desertion and that Jon Snow and Sam stole his comfortable position as Maester Aemon's steward: and that Jon Snow stole his position.

>'""He could feel tears freezing to his cheeks. It isn't fair, he wanted to scream. **Snow would ruin everything he'd worked for, all his careful plans.** It was a heavy fall, thick white flakes coming down all about him. How would they find their food caches in the snow, or the game trail they meant to follow east? They won't need Dywen nor Bannen to hunt us down neither, not if we're tracking through fresh snow. And snow hid the shape of the ground, especially by night. A horse could stumble over a root, break a leg on a stone. We're done, he realized. Done before we began. We're lost. There'd be no lord's life for the leechman's son, no keep to call his own, no wives nor crowns. Only a wildling's sword in his belly, and then an unmarked grave. **The snow's taken it all from me ""¶ the bloody snow ""¶""ù**

>**'""Snow had ruined him once before. Snow and his pet pig.""ù**

>(ASOS Prologue)

&nbsp;

And later we have Jon Snow introduced as as '""the snow of winterfell""ù""¶""¶

>'""The singer rose to his feet. ""I'm Mance Rayder,""ù he said as he put aside the lute. '""And you are Ned Stark's bastard, **the Snow of Winterfell.""ù**
>( A Storm of Swords ""ì Jon I)


&nbsp;


Then comes Sansa's chapter at the end of the book, where she will feel snow falling down her lips and touching her almost like a lover""¶""¶..

&nbsp;

>Snow was falling on the Eyrie.


>Yet she stepped out all the same. Her boots tore ankle-deep holes into the smooth white surface of the snow, yet made no sound. Sansa drifted past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees, and wondered if she were still dreaming. Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover's kisses, and melted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes. **She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.**

>(A Storm of Swords - Sansa VIII)


This last paragraph is very dear to my heart. How George foreshadows Jon and Sansa first kiss its one of the sweetest parts of the books. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **IN A FEAST FOR CROWS ""ì SANSA'S FIRST LOVE**

In A FEAST FOR CROWS, chapter 23, we have Sansa playing the role of Alayne Stone, Littlefinger bastard daughter. In this chapter Sansa remembers Lord Yohn Royce son,  Ser Wayman Royce and how she fell madly in love with him when he visited Winterfell on his way to take the black on the Nights Watch. If we go back to the prologue of the first book, we will find out that surprising, Ser Waymar physical description is identical of Jon Snow. George is trying to tell us that Sansa will probably be physical attracted to Jon Snow once she is reunited with him later in the story.  (randomtvramblings was the first to notice this detail).

>""Bronze Yohn knows me,"" she reminded him. ""He was a guest at Winterfell when his son rode north to take the black."" **She had fallen wildly in love with Ser Waymar, she remembered dimly, but that was a lifetime ago, when she was a stupid little girl.** ""And that was not the only time. Lord Royce saw . . . he saw Sansa Stark again at King's Landing, during the Hand's tourney.""

> A FEAST FOR CROWS,  Alayne I


&nbsp;


In the A GAME OF THRONES prologue, Waymar Royce is described as follows:

&nbsp;


>Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, **grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife**. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. 

>A GAME OF THRONES, Prologue

&nbsp;

Notice how similar this description is to Jon:

&nbsp;

>**Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black**, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. **Jon was slender** where Robb was muscular, **dark** where Robb was fair, **graceful and quick** where his half brother was strong and fast.

>A GAME OF THRONES, Bran I

&nbsp;


Jon Snow and Ser Waymar Royce are very similar phisically, and Waymar was the first crush of Sansa. I believe George was trying to tells us that Sansa will be attracted to Jon Snow once they are reunited on Castle Black..

&nbsp;

* **JON SNOW BECOMING THE HERO OF SANSA'S DREAMS""¶..**


>'""Sweet one,""ù her father said gently, '""listen to me. When you're old enough, I will make you a match with a high lord who's worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong. This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake. **That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.""ù** 

>( A Game of Thrones ""ì Sansa III)
 
........

>She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, **for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard.** 

>(A Clash of Kings ""ì Sansa IV)
 
..........

>They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes. '""I'm Prince Aemon the Dragonknight,""ù Jon would call out, and Robb would shout back, '""Well, I'm Florian the Fool.""ù Or Robb would say, '""I'm the Young Dragon,""ù and Jon would reply, **'""I'm Ser Ryam Redwyne.""ù** 

A Storm of Swords ""ì Jon II

Notice how Sansa's heros match with with the ones Jon's used to pretend to be as a child. 

&nbsp;


>'""Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, **wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head.**

>A game of Thrones ""ì Sansa VI 

&nbsp;


>""I will not hang him,"" said Jon. ""Bring him here."" ""Oh, Seven save us,"" he heard Bowen Marsh cry out. The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, **""Edd, fetch me a block,""** and unsheathed Longclaw. 

>A dance of Dragons ""ì Jon II

&nbsp;

* **AND FINALLY, THEIR DREAMS COMPLETING EACH OTHER'S""¶""¶.**

&nbsp;

One of the sweetest things about the tale of ASOAIF, it's the realization that Jon and Sansa are having the same dreams about their future, without each other knowing about it. They dream of peace, going back to home and rebuilding their ancestral home; they dream about marriage and having children named by the brothers they lost in the war; they want to rebuild the family they believe its gone for ever""¶..

&nbsp;


>'""She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in their laps, or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while they floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge. **""If I give him Sons, he may come to love me.** She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon**, and raise them all to be as Valiant as Ser Loras. And to hate Lannisters, too. In Sansa's dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya.""ù 

>A STORM OF SWORDS, Sansa II

>'""I would need to steal her if I wanted her love, **but she might give me children**. I might someday hold a son of my own blood in my arms. A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of, since he decide to live his life on the wall. **I could name him Robb""ù**..-

>A STORM OF SWORDS, Jon XII

&nbsp;

Rebuilding Winterfell""¶""¶

&nbsp;

>The snow fell and the castle rose. Two walls ankle-high, the inner taller than the outer. Towers and turrets, keeps and stairs, a round kitchen, a square armory, the stables along the inside of the west wall. It was only a castle when she began, **but before very long Sansa knew it was Winterfell.**

>A Storm of Swords - Sansa VII

>**Winterfell, he thought.** Theon left it burned and broken, **but I could restore it. Surely his father would have wanted that, and Robb as well**. They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins.

>A Storm of Swords - Jon XII

&nbsp;

So, yeahh, I dont understand when people keep telling me there is no foreshadowing of this romance in the books, when in my opnion, its one of the most foreshadowed matches in the entire novel. 


BTW, they are no only foreshadowed to be in a romance, but also, to be the final King and Queen of this story.................

&nbsp;

______________________________

* **JON AS A KING**

Jon Snow foreshadowing as the final King is found pretty much on every single book from the series. 

&nbsp;


>**""Kings are a rare sight in the north.""**

>Robert snorted. ""More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!""

&nbsp;


>**""King,"" croaked the raven.** The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont's shoulder. **""King,"" it said again**, strutting back and forth.

>""He likes that word,"" Jon said, smiling.

>""An easy word to say. An easy word to like.""

>**""King,"" the bird said again.**

>""I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.""

>""The realm has three kings already, and that's two too many for my liking."" Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger, **but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow.**

>It made him feel odd. 

Jon I, ACOK


&nbsp;

>He rose and dressed in darkness, as Mormont's raven muttered across the room. ""Corn,"" the bird said, and, **""King,"" and, ""Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.""** That was queer. The bird had never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall.

>He had another cup of wine as he dressed, then took his wife by the arm and escorted her from the Kitchen Keep to join the river of silk, satin, and velvet flowing toward the throne room. Some guests had gone inside to find their places on the benches. Others were milling in front of the doors, enjoying the unseasonable warmth of the afternoon. **Tyrion led Sansa around the yard, to perform the necessary courtesies.**

>**She is good at this, he thought**, as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that his cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown, and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first time he'd left his sickbed since the battle. He looks ghastly. Lancel's hair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick. Without his father beside him holding him up, he would surely have collapsed. Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. **She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he'd had the sense to love her. He wondered if his nephew was capable of loving anyone.**

A Feast for Crows - Alayne II



&nbsp;


As I said before, I believe Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will marry and rule the 7 kingdoms as King and Queen by the end of this story....


TLDR - Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will marry in the final season and rule Westeros as the final King and Queen.

",SPOILER
" I got a quick question for you guys. I started rewatching the show and I'm currently on season 1 episode 5. When Arya is in the dungeons she overhears Varys and Illyrio Mopatis speaking about the Dothraki coming to Westeros, Illyrio says he wants more time because Khal Drogo will wait for his son to be born, while Varys asks him to speed it up, since there is a war starting between the Lannisters and the Starks. 

Illyrio was the one that organized the marriage between Dany and Drogo. It seems like Varys was in on the plan too and like they're partners. So why does he want Dany killed immediately after that scene? Is he playing Illyrio and just using him for information? It seems like he was helping coming up with the plan to bring Dany and Drogo together though. Why would he do that and then decide to kill her? What did I miss? Did it have something to do with Ned not being like the previous hand? ",SPOILER
"You probably heard about the Tourney of Ashford theory before. 

If you don't know small explanation; (you can skip to the next paragraph if you know)

Sansa's marriages/bethrotals are going same order with 5 champions of Lord Ashford's daughter.
1. Lyonel Baratheon. ""î Joffrey Baratheon
2. Leo Tyrell ""î Willas Tyrell
3. Tybolt Lannister ""î Tyrion Lannister
4. Humphrey Hardyng ""î Harry Hardyng
5. Valarr Targaryen ""î ???

So what do you think? Can this theory be true? If it is, who can be the one as Targaryen category?",SPOILER
"I'm a lurker who just enjoys reading other people's theories, no matter how crazy some might seem. Ha.

Anyway, the question of who really owned the Valeryan steel dagger that was used by Brandon's assassin comes up frequently, but my question is...

Why did whoever want Bran dead deem it necessary to use such an elaborate blade in the first place? Any old knife or dagger would have done the job, so why was the assassin equipped with such a fine weapon? 

I'm not buying these theories about Bran being the Night King or whatever, too much of a flight of fancy for me, but why try to kill him with that particular blade? Being caught was risky because the blade could lead back to someone (which happened!) and why waste a valuable asset on a common cutthroat? Is it just lazy writing, and the only reason was so they could link it someone in later episodes. 

Always seemed odd. Just wondered if anyone can think of another reason it had to be that weapon that killed Bran.",SPOILER
"I know it would throw the whole storyline off because it would be obvious he was a Targaryen, but I just think it's so crazy and cool that the Targaryen's have such strong bloodlines, but Jon's the most Stark-looking of them all. Especially after everything that happened with Robert and Joffery, and ""the seed is strong"".

I think it'd be kind of cool if he had white hair and Ned made up some bullshit like he was cursed as the Stark bastard with white hair. Like if he was super Stark looking, just with white hair.

I mean, they do call him the White Wolf...",SPOILER
"I know someone just posted about this but I wanted to go in a little more detail on why I feel like it's true. I remember Jamie saying the Mad Kings last words were something along the line of  '""burn them all, just like he had by saying the past few hours""ù. 
    I see a huge connection between the Hodor storyline and the Mad King. Bran probably went back to the Mad King in a vision and someone yelling burn them all, maybe dead bodies in winterfell during a white walker attack, got it into the Mad Kings head. 
     I don't really see the point of having Ned being able to somewhat hear Bran in his vision and Hodors whole storyline if it wasn't leading up to this. ",SPOILER
"What if at some point King Stannis reappears, and then everyone bends the knee to him and he leads his people against the white walkers? That would be EPIC, but probably too intelligent a twist for D&D",SPOILER
" Season 8 will be an epic finale to the journey to win the game of thrones. These are my predictions of events and aftermaths, not fact or canon.

White Walkers: The White Walkers will be the greatest threat known to the Westerlands since the first arrival of the Dragons. The White Walkers shall reak untold destruction and slaughter any unable to get away as they ravage the North. Battle after battle they shall win as all the houses are unable to unite and face as one host to combat the white walkers individually losing battles. Until the final battle when just once the Kingdom has sent all hit has against the White Walkers. It will be an epic battle involving the hundreds of thousands of troops both Living and unliving. For every soldier killed in battle he becomes undead and attacks his comrades who just a moment ago fought alongside. It will be a brutal victory that will only end once Jon Snow and Daenerys ride both dragons to kill the Ice Dragon and the Night king in an Epic Duel.

House Targaryen-

Daenerys Targaryen: Daenerys will survive the events of Got and will end up either as Queen in the Westerlands or my own personal theory as Khaleesi in Essos.

House Stark-

Jon Snow: The King of the North Jon Snow or Aegon Targaryen Either using his former name if independence in the North is achieved or the latter if he ends up in a marriage with  Daenerys Targaryen. He will be the main opponent to the Night King and it's possible he will slay the Night King on the battlefield. Jon will definitely survive the game of thrones.

Sansa Stark: Sansa Stark will rule Winterfell and become the Head of House Stark as Jon Snow is ineligible to become the head of the house. Sansa is no fighter and will mostly remain as a political figure managing the North's safety from the incoming White Walker threat. Sansa will be with Arya as more of a background figure in the main events.

Bran Stark: Bran will act as the rook for the Stark family. He is not the most important piece but he can be immensely helpful in securing victory. Bran will be useful in facing the White Walkers but I would say 50% of him living till the end.

Arya Stark: Arya has come along way with a lot of character development but she doesn't seem to fit in any role, her apparent usefulness is lacking as she is neither political or a good leader which is critical in this finale season. I don't see her doing much but she will survive in the end.

House Lannister-

Cersei  Lannister: Cersei is the current Queen but she has too many enemies and not enough allies with her forces depleted and resorting to buying mercenaries that number a few thousand will not keep her alive. She will die not by anyone but her own brother's hands-not Tyrion...Jaime. Tyrion may want to kill his sister but it will be Jaime that deals the killing blow to his sister and lover.

Jaime Lannister: Humbled in the years since the start of GOT he is like a different man than he used to be. He will see the White Walkers as a bigger threat than any game of thrones that Cersei likes to play and in the situation will end her life. Jaime will survive the events and assume the head of House Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister: Tyrion is a man both conflicted and troubled. His own family excluding Jaime bear him no love and he has allied himself with the enemy Daenerys Targaryen. He shall have to choose family or friends and him choosing either could either leave to life or death something that he has stated multiple times he wants to live. I do believe he will survive and become Hand of the King/Queen

House Greyjoy-

Euron Greyjoy: Euron will remain on the Salt Throne. His boasts and taunts to both enemies and allies alike will prove him to be close to death yet he shall remain as ruler of the  Iron Islands. He will kill Theon and Yara Greyjoy.

Theon Greyjoy: Theon is a cockless man with support from about a dozen Ironborn raiders(from that fistfight) after his sister was taken captive.  I doubt he poses a major threat so long as no one helps him and as long as Daenerys doesn't burn down the Iron fleet or kill Euron I doubt Theon can do much of anything but die.

Yara Greyjoy: Yara Greyjoy will be killed by Euron. She will be kept in a dungeon and pose no threat to Euron but in the event, Theon tries to rescue her will be killed by the guards.

House Clegane-

Sandor Clegane: The Hound still has unfinished business with his brother. Sandor's story culminates in the fight and killing of his brother Gregor. It will be in the North the fight happens between them.

Gregor Clegane: The Mountain will be reanimated by the Night King. No longer Qyburn's project he shall rampage across wherever he is at the moment

House Bronn

Bronn-Gets Gold, Women and Castles

That's my predictions for Season 8. Do you agree or disagree share your thoughts? I'd make a Tl:Dr but I'm getting bored of writing so much.",SPOILER
"So we know that hodors death being experienced in his past self made him have the seizure, and while he didn't go mad, it definitely messed him up. I dont remember exactly where it is but there is a scene where bran is looking into the past and it is alluded that aerys and the white walkers are linked. I'm thinking that the three eyed raven was involved with him going insane and the reason he wants to ""burn it all"" is because he is afraid of the white walkers coming.

"Many people are saying that seasons 5 and 6 were bad. Opinion Alert! I disagree.

1. 5 and 6 had 10 episodes.

2. The timeframe was normal. No jumping 2 months in a 5 minutes. 

3. Sure there was alot of crappy Fantasy, but they had a healthy ratio of Politcs as well.

4. It still felt like the Game of Thrones we love. 

&#x200B;

However, Season 7 was the worst season I have EVER seen on television. So many plot holes bug me. In Ep 4 and 5 why didnt the writers make Dany capture Jaime so that he could be brought beyond the wall as a witness of the dead to tell Cercei? In Ep 3, how did the Lannisters take Highgarden without seige weapons? Wasn't there a massive Tyrel army? And of course Ep 6 was the worst. Way too many fake deaths, with Jon falling in the water and Jorah almost falling off the dragon. Who do HBO think we are, 10 year olds? If Season 7 was longer, the story could have been better explained. It is almost unbearable watching. I cringe at every time jump. 

&#x200B;

Hopefuly Season 8 will listen to the fans and be better.

EDIT:

Also 7x6 was just a CGI, cliche fantasy shitshow. The whole stupid expedition could have been simpler if the writers made Dany capture Jaime and bring him beyond the wall as a witness to Cercei. Jorah falling off the dragon, holding on to someone's hand; I've seen similar scenes across hundreds of different movies and TV shows. Jon falling into the water fake death? Perfect waste of time. Uncle Benjin shows up for like 10 seconds just to die? WTF.

Was all of Season 7 shit? No. But now it's more of a fantasy show. If I wanted fantasy, I could watch LoTR, which does fantasy better. No, most people (Me included) love GoT for it's political storylines. S6 was a bit more fantasy than the previous seasons but it had a healthy mix of fantasy and politics. Season seven however: Oof.",SPOILER
"I don't think I'm emotionally equipped for a Jon and Arya reunion...it might well be too much for the cold, heart-shaped void in my chest.",SPOILER
"I've seen a lot of people complain that Season 7 is the weakest of the whole series. I really didn't have much of a problem with it, I enjoyed the sense of things finally coming together and the dread of the long-fabled winter finally arriving. That being said, yeah, it had some pretty weak moments >cough ice lake cough< and the dialogue isn't quite what it used to be. Other than that, though, I think I'm satisfied with the direction things are going and I'm anxious to see how it all ends. 
If you feel the same way, what are you looking forward to in Season 8? 
And if you weren't as happy with S7's turns and changes, what do you think should happen that could bring the show back to its former glory?",SPOILER
That Jon should've given karhold and the last hearth to other northern houses.,SPOILER
Throughout the series it is showcased multiple times that bastards are extremely disliked and treated as scum and I was wondering why? Why hate the child when it's not even their fault? Shouldn't all the blame fall on the cheating parent? And if so have there been any repercussions on these parents because so far I have not seen any punishments for those who participate in infidelity.,SPOILER
"So I was wondering, considering the fact that the Karstarks are the only, to my knowledge, remaining cadet branch of Stark family, or at least the most powerful, shouldn't they capitalize off their claim to the Lordship of the North? At some point post red wedding, once the Boltons had solidified their claim to winterfell and are now trying to consolidate loyalty from the other northern houses, Ramsay Bolton says that the Umbers, Manderlys, and Karstarks command more men than the rest of the northern houses combined. Now the Boltons, being the historic rivals of house Stark, would also be somewhere within this top 3, but this would still leaves the Karstarks at LEAST the fourth most powerful house in the North. Due to the lore in the books, it is known that the Karstarks are direct descendants from a member of the Starks family, Karlen Stark, who was given some land and his own keep, naming it Karhold and his family branch would come to be known as the Karstarks. This officially makes Lord Harrion Karstark, Lord of Karhold, at the point of the Red Wedding, the man in the whole of the Seven Kingdoms with the most Stark blood (Stark-iest, if you will) that isn't presumed dead/a sworn brother of the nights watch AND a bastard/essentially a prisoner in kings landing.

So because the Karstarks have a pretty big army as it is, and the best claim to the northern throne in the seven kingdoms (other than bran and Rickon, who are presumed dead), it would stand to reason that a substantial amount of northern houses would come to their aid in a possible northern civil war. Not that it would be much of a war anyways, as the Boltons may have some historical allies, they certainly can't fend off an army of, presumably, tens of thousands of northmen fighting for who they believe is there rightful leader. 

'""The north remembers""ù they say, and I don't believe in this case they're any less likely to do so. 

In the end, I never read the books in full, so I was just wondering if there was some answer in there as to why exactly the Karstarks didn't challenge the Boltons after the extinction of the starks.",SPOILER
Why does Jon want to hide his being killed and ressurection from Danaerys? ,SPOILER
"Davos learns that Shireen was burned by Melisandre. He calls her out in front of Jon. It's a very well acted scene. I'd describe the scene itself as powerful. I'd describe the emotions as raw. But I don't think it's anywhere near as good as everyone has made it out to be.

It's rightfully the point in the story worth remembering because that whole sequence finally reaches its payoff from setting up Davos and Shireen's relationship. But acting talents on this show (IMO) are best expressed in subtleties and buildups. Stannis slowly but steadily declines into unhinged madness. We see the journey of a resolute man doing whatever it takes to save the world and stake his claim. But each and every step of the way, Stephen Dillane delivers on this descent into the abyss. You can even see the rationalization seep out of his face as he sets his new course.

I just find those moments much more noteworthy of brilliant portrayals rather than the explosions of emotions and climaxes that are supplemented and amplified by their overall context.",SPOILER
"Did Jon meet his match with Karl Tanner? I look back at all of Jon's one-on-one fight scenes and the only person he seemed to have a lot of trouble with was Karl, in fact he seemed completely outclassed by him. Craster's girl sneaking in with the knife was nothing short of a miracle.

&#x200B;

I've asked around and a lot of people claim that Jon was at a disadvantage with a long sword inside a tent, but if you're an elite fighter like Jon, you've clearly figured out how to use your preferred weapon in any circumstantial setting. Jon knew what he was getting into stepping inside that tent.

&#x200B;

All in all, Karl was an extremely skilled fighter for a dude who spent all his time in a cabin getting drunk and raping women. I'm surprised we saw so little of him.",SPOILER

"I'm rewatching the series (again) and I noticed something I hadn't notice before. I don't know if anyone has pointed this out before, but in season 3 episode 10 Bran tells the story of the Rat Cook at the Night Fort. The night's watch cook who served a king a pie filled with his own son, as punishment the Gods transformed the cook into a white rat that would feast on his young, forever hungry. However, the Gods did not punish him for murder but rather for killing a guest in under his roof. Obviously, this is following the Red Wedding and this is alluding to Walder Frey murdering guests under his roof. When Arya takes revenge on Walder Frey she feeds him a pie of made from his sons, he was forced to feed on his young as punishment for murdering guests under his care, just like the Rat Cook. 

TLDR; Walder Frey is the Rat Cook being forced to eat his children out of punishment. ",SPOILER
"I've watched the new GoT teaser several times trying to figure out what it all means because I'm not convinced it's as pointless as others seem to think it is. 

And I've been a little disappointed in the lack if fan theories based on the teaser.

So, here's my prediction for season 8 based on the trailer: 

The show will confirm a theory that The Great Other (the god of darkness, cold, evil, fear, and death) is imprisoned in Winterfell's crypts and that when the Starks left, the Others began raising an army of the dead so they could basically invade Winterfell and break The Great Other free. Whatever magic was used to imprison him basically dragged the Stark children all back to Winterfell. And here's where I'm a little more uncertain. 

We know there must always be a Stark in Winterfell and part of this theory about The Great Other's imprisonment is that Stark blood was used in a blood magic ritual to imprison him there. So, their presence will either re-strengthen whatever enchantments are binding him to Winterfell or the Starks were gone for too long and he will break free no matter what, but the Starks (and Daenerys and her dragons) are the only ones who stand a chance of trying to resist the Others when they invade Winterfell to break their god free.

The statues in the trailer make a lot of sense with this theory too. Some people are speculating that this scene doesn't happen in the show and others are saying it's a dream (which is entirely possible because there are lots of dreams about the crypts in the books). The only manifestation of his power that we've seen comes from the Others/White Walkers, so we don't really know what he can do. I have a hard time believing he would evoke fear in the Starks by showing them statues of themselves because it seems like he could do significantly more based off what we've seen the Others do, but the statues do represent death and they could make the Starks afraid because most people are afraid of death. The crypts are filled with icy air after they see their statue. Nevertheless, I'm not completely writing off that The Great Other is showing them these statues. At the very least, if this scene will occur in the show as a dream, it could definitely be interpreted as foreshadowing the release of The Great Other.

And we see basically everything The Great Other controls in the trailer. We see death (or, more accurately, a foreshadowing of death) which creates fear. We see icy air invade the dark crypts. I'm not sure the trailer directly shows us evil. But, when the ice fills the crypts, we know the dead come with it. Not only does it hint at the ""evilness"" of the Others, but it could also be like a meta foreshadowing of The Great Other's release. He is, after all, R'hollor's antithesis.

Disclaimer: I don't read the books and most if what I know about The Great Other comes from reading other fan theories. ",SPOILER

Small forward; Khal Drogo (great size but great speed)

With her black armor, qybern as her hand, and zombie clegane as commander of the kingsguard. I would say an alliance between her and the night king is all but certain. Especially with the looming threat of John and Dany. I dont think she cares about her unborn child not enough to flee. Its pretty obvious the way she desperately clings to that throne. That meeting shouldve been it. She flys in on a dragon to the dragon pit and shes still stupid enough to call her a would-be usurper. Its over she extended a truce and her pride got in the way. If she keeps that crap up The night king is gona seem like the best option to her.",SPOILER
"Watching the seasons through a few times you can see the crazy influence Lord Baelish has on the whole story line.

I've seen people complain on this sub on how sudden his death was, and how he seemed careless leading up to it. This was out of character and the story line was getting rushed. I always disagreed.

I'm watching the seasons through again and while he was definitely very careful with how he planned everything, he took a huge risk killing Lysa in front of Sansa.

If Sansa had of just told the truth the lords of the Vale would have killed Baelish right then and there.

Yes his death was sudden but I feel that those moments are what makes Game of Thrones so great. I think at that point he felt invincible and could influence just about anyone.",SPOILER
"Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the throne. Here was a bastard, dejected and despised, cast aside. Jon, by the virtue of his morality, fairness and courage, worked his way up. He, unlike so many other characters on the show, earned his power with grace and trust. What an incredibly powerful message.

Oh, but by the way, he was the king all along!

"If we assume the Targaryens are the rightful monarchs of Westeros, the line of succession would have gone from the Mad King, to his oldest son (Rhaegar, killed in battle), then to Rhaegar's children (murdered by the Mountain) then to Viserys (Dead) then to Daenerys just like the show and books show. However, we now know that John Snow is the legitimate son of Rhaegar which would have bumped him up in the line of succession before Viserys and Daenerys, but Rhaegar and his other children died before John was born, so you could argue that when John was born the crown had already rightfully passed to Viserys and would then go to Daenerys before John or since that never happened John is in the next in line behind the Mad King.

So the question is, who has a better claim to the throne, John or Dany? If Westeros if following british rules, would an unborn child trump a younger sibling? Are there any real world precedents for something like this or could this end up being whatever the Westerosi equivalent of a constitutional crisis?",SPOILER
"1. Dany will die. Possibly killed on her dragon in battle. BUT before that she has a baby with Jon or someone else.

2. The people of Kings landing will revolt against Cercie.

4. Bran is the night king and Arya has an epic battle with him, they both die.

"I have been giving some thought to the prophecy that says two kings dying in succession can wake a dragon. I have seen many theories by fans regarding whether Jon is also a human dragon. I think he is after his resurrection, and here is WHY:

""Two kings to wake a dragon. The father, and then the son, so they both die kings.""

Melisandre has been trying to (mistakenly) wake (actual) dragons by trying to use/sacrifice (in both books and show) a child of Robert. But both Edric Storm (in the books) and Gendry (in the show) are BASTARDS. Their father's death does not make them kings and THAT is the main part of the prophecy. It takes TWO KINGS. 

 Both Melisandre and fans have been too obsessed with the ""father and son"" bit and lost the crucial ""both die kings"" bit. I have seen theories about Jon's grandfather and uncle's deaths on his mother's side counting for it, but no, they were no official kings, even though their ancestors were. 

The show might have messed this up a bit with Daenaerys for one and her 'human dragon' abilities of resisting fire. The show kinda hints at it from the beginning. But there's no indication of it in the books. I believe she became/'woke' as a dragon by the ritual of the priestess only following the deaths of Drogo and his son, thus 'king' and 'heir' (I have seen it being argumented that Drogo died after Rhaego but Drogo WAS dead; the witch just brought him back as a spiritless carcass, he wasn't truly alive anymore). And so she was 'woken'.

In Jon's case, yes, Rhaegar's and Aerys' deaths don't count for it, bc Rhaegar died a prince. BUT-

I don't know what the show did with that, bc I didn't watch that season, but in the books, before going to the Twins, Robb's wife was not pregnant (tho I know she was in the show so they messed shit up again) and he thought all his other siblings were dead. He was worried about not having an heir. And so he called a meeting. And he made everyone sign an official document that, in the event of his death with no children, Jon would be released of his vow, legitimatised and declared king/his righteous heir. Bc Robb was a king, he COULD do that, yes. Maester Aemon would've been freed of his vow before him and become king had he accepted it.

Of course, shit went downhill after the Red Wedding. BUT, by all official matters, Jon was made heir of the North throne\ presumed king by law. But THEN he died, too. Thus, Robb/the king and his heir/presumed king died, both technically dying kings. A ritual would then ""awaken"" Jon, also of Targaryen blood, so also capable of being a woken dragon.

""Two kings to wake a dragon"". The explanation why Daenaerys has her powers of all Targaryens, and possible proof that Jon will be another 'dragon'.

(Also this being a Targaryen thing bc of their connection with dragons might explain so many Targaryens' obsession with it. It has been possible for them before, as well, but at great costs.)",SPOILER
"So I'm on the Jon and the Night King die boat.   I haven't seen much trying to predict their deaths but I think they are going to fight and ultimately kill each other.  How?  A repeat of history where Jon and the Night King are fighting on dragons, but at some point the two collide.  Jon leaps off of Rhaegal onto Viserion, stabbing the Night King.   After the collision Rhaegal and Jon fall to their deaths.  Dany and Drogon are unable to help Jon and Rhaegal because (insert D&D reason here).  This will mirror the events from the [Battle Above the Gods Eye](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_Above_the_Gods_Eye).   Maybe this actually occurs over the Gods Eye since we see the ice and fire meet there in the first trailer we got this year (I think it's called Dragnstone).

&#x200B;

I think this could be visually stunning and emotional for the audience.  Imagine watching Jon leaping in air and as he kills the Night King and an ice explosion occurs.  Grounded characters see wights and wight walkers collapse/die but then  they look up and see Jon and Rhaegal falling out of the sky.  Each character would have their own reaction to this as the camera sweeps across the survivors.  Picture Arya and Davos sprinting towards Jon, while Sansa and Dany just cover their mouths in shock.  The last image we have of Jon is him closing his eyes just before he hits the ground, accepting his death.  Dany cannot save Jon, that would be too cheesy and would go against what GoT is supposed to be.  Emotionally as the audience we will (most of us) be happy as the Night King dies, but then we realize that the hero is making the ultimate sacrifice. Thus a bitter-sweet ending to the war against death. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Jon and Night King kill each other by events like the link above.",SPOILER
"When Meera left Bran it never sat right with me, not due to the rudeness of the three eyed ravBran but instead at how it didn't really make sense. Meera and Jojen went north on their fathers wishes and they went to find Bran. They knew that Bran was the key to winning the war as Jojen had stated. She out of every living person knows that Bran must survive for the Long Night to be won yet she decides to leave the crippled boy with family he hasn't seen in years and other dodgy characters around. He is the true born heir to Winterfell and if someone wanted him out of the picture, which they well could, he's an easy target. But Meera left and her excuse: 

**I don't want to leave you, but when-- when they come, I need to be with my family.
And you're safe**

I have been thinking about it recently and here are my thoughts. Go back to the first tower of Joy scene and we see Bloodraven introducing Bran to who is there. He clearly says out loud that Howland Reed is Meera's father, something that you'd think Bran would know already. But I am starting to think that Bloodraven wasn't speaking to Bran but to the audience. So the audience, well casual viewers are reminded about Meera's father and then they know that Meera is with her family. Meera is with Howland and if you are like me and think we haven't seen the end of her then it will be **Meera bringing Howland into the mix** 

**Why**

That's the question. What part does Howland play. Well he was there when Jon was born so he is the last living person who knows but is that his role? Will an old Crannogman's opinion be enough to convince everyone that Jon is Targaryen. Maybe he will just reveal to Jon, but why? Sam and Bran can do that fine. Well realistically I think that could be his role in the show but I had another thought, I dawned the tin foil: 

**DAWN - He will bring Dawn to the North as Dawn is Lightbringer**

Now IF Lightbringer is to appear, I don't even really think that it will to be honest but IF it is then it can't be a Valyrian steel sword. We know that Lightbringer was forged 8000 years ago in Westeros, long before the Valyrians had any influence in Westeros, maybe Lightbringer was crafted into Valyrian Steel eventually or maybe Dawn, the sword that is different than all others and just as sharp as Valyrian Steel. 

The book says a member of House Dayne followed a falling Star and Dawn came from it and then Ned left it to Ashara Dayne. There is no mention of that in the show so there is some license here to work with. Howland killing Arthur Dayne was strange and didn't make any real difference to the story, unless of course Ned gives the sword to Howland because it was Howland who killed Dayne and not Ned and since then Howland has had the sword and will be shown the importance of it. 

**Disclaimer**

I am not even a big follower of Lightbringer being in the show, I know this theory isn't flawless and it's more brainstorming from me than anything else but I am convinced that Meera will return, I think the mention of her family and Howland will mean that he will be in the next series for sure and I know that there is a good chance it's just to reveal to Jon in the books at least I think he will be the one to reveal. But with the reveal already covered by Sam and Bran there must be more to Howland Reed's potential appearance than that. 

A point was made of showing Dawn on the screen and it hasn't been revisited yet, I think that Howland Reed could have the sword or even more than that knows where it is **cough cough** Crypts of Winterfell **cough cough** sorry I had something in my throat there. 

I am not even sure I am correct but I do think my line of thinking has narrative sense to back it up and you just never know. Guess we will find out in June. I hope anyone takes time to read this and hope you like it as much as I liked writing it

so through the past few years i have been re-watching my favorite films together with my S.O., who hasn't watched any of them (like LOTR, Star Wars, MCU, etc.). Her reactions to those plot-twists, deaths, epic, heroic goose bump inducing moments so far have been entertaining to me, worth sitting for hours and re-watching the movies again just for it.

I reckon Game of Thrones will surprise her the most, considering she hates deaths and always expects that plot armor will save main characters, and just how likable most of the characters are.

We don't have a lot of time together and watching every single episode with her will take ages, and we would like to watch the last season together.

"I don't know if this is one of the existing theories, but it came to my mind so I wanted to share it with you.

The Night King wants his Night Prince/Princess that was promised to take him/her up to the lands of always winter. The men will first lose the battle of Winterfell and then Cersei/Daenerys conflict will happen and Night King will rise all the dead they leave behind...  Daenerys will be killed in that major fight at the Isle of Faces/King's landing. Jon will use the same technique as Children used on Benjen and will stab her through her heart with a piece of dragonglass. This will revive her and she will leave far north with NK to become the Night Queen and give birth to her and Jon's baby (prince/princess) which will one day become the next Night King. Jon will become the ruler of 7 kingdoms, with his dragon Rhaegal. Daenery's fire will become ice, the icy Snow will become the fiery Targaryen. They will again bring balance to the world of ice and fire.",SPOILER

"Such a fun topic because there are so many options with such unique backgrounds. Whoever you choose explain why, was it a specific scene, action, or just personality in general!

Personally my favorite is Jamie Lannister. I think his development from the man he was early on and who he is now is great. Now he is a fan favorite arguably after being more hated than Cersei was at the beginning 

Can't go wrong with Jon Snow and Tyrion as well",SPOILER
"I know that there are already a lot of theories surrounding the night king but was it ever explained why the ""experiment"" on one of the first men by the children of the Forrest that resulted in the night king/white walkers failed? 

Seems like a big mcguffin to me to just have it as ""it just failed and turned against them"".


Could it have been that that the man they turned was a direct ancestor of the starks? And that their ""warg"" ability was something the children weren't aware of and that made the night king uncontrollable/turn against the children. 

His ability to control the undead could also be a form of warging. 

This might also explain why presumably cold hands/ benjen stark is still a wight with self control... 

Excuses me if this had already been discussed to death.

"## Do we have any indication how much time and resources it takes to produce a scorpion in their era?

I read that in medieval times a suit of armor for a knight cost as much as a house. If large wooden weapons are the same maybe they can't make hundreds of them. Maybe a few dozen max. And that doesn't consider the time to build.

" So after rewatching the series, i still have quite a few questions, im not sure if i 'missed' it or if the tv show doesn't explain it, but maybe you guys who have more knowledge than me, can help me understand it better:

\- Gods: This may not seem relevant, but it annoys me a little. Which God/religion is the real one? How come Both the Lord of Light be real (judging by the 'visions' in the flames, the blood magic, the rebirth of Beric and Jon etc..) as well as the Many-faced God (Jaqen H'ghar and the house of black and white along with the faceless men), as well as the Drowned God (Euron's 'baptism' where he drowned and came back to life).

\- Is Jaqen H'ghar the Many-Faced God or what? And why did he let Arya live instead of killing her while she was wounded and holding Needle against his chest? Why did he let her get away with it?

\- What's up with Qyburn and how the hell did he actually manage to 'zombify' and enhance the Mountain? Is he secretly serving a God? The Lord of Light or something? Im not sure why no one seems to be giving that attention, if he can wake up the dead and make them stronger than before, shouldn't that be talked about more?

\- When the Three-Eyed Raven told Bran that 'it was time for him to learn everything', why did he show him how Hodor became a 'half-wit'? Is there something important that i'm missing?

\- Why does everyone seem to be scared of Milk of the Poppy? Sounds stupid, but Jaime refused to drink it when he was getting his hand fixed, he prefered to yell out and endure the pain rather than drink a numbing drink? And Arya also hesitated to drink it when she was being treated by Lady Crane..

\- Benjen 'explained' how he was saved at 1:20 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkArs3vL8oU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkArs3vL8oU) he says that a white walker stabbed him in the guts and he was 'left to turn' ... and was saved by having dragonglass plunged in his heart? The fuck? First of all, if he was still considered a human, both these wounds would've killed him, and if he was turning (and judging by his looks, he already has turned for 40%), wouldn't the dragonglass shatter him as well, since it shatters white walkers?

\- Follow-up on Benjen, how the fuck did he get a flaming mace? Isn't that only reserved for people who follow the Lord of Light?

\- What the fuck did Podrick do to those whores?

I have more questions, but i'll leave it at this for now.

"Sansa.
This is an additional post to my one about King Bran.  In addition to the weird skewed betting odds in Bran's favor that make no sense, it is odd that Sansa is so far down in the betting odds.  Sansa's whole arc is based on learning to rule so it makes sense that she would end up as a ruler - as Queen Elizabeth I.  Just based on her arc and where the books/ show are taking her, I'd say that she is the #2 most likely of the non-Targaryens to end up ruling Westeros.  (Oh and this has nothing to do with shipping.  Sansa would rule alone in her own right if it happened.)   ",SPOILER

Since the new prequel show is about the long night do you think the night king of the current show is going to be the same as the one in the prequel?

"I think all of us want someone to sit in the iron throne at the end of GOT and throughout the show we see dany and jon go through alot of obstacles in their life just to set them up for the throne and both of them want to build a better place under their rule, jon didn't say it directly but we sure agree if he is the king the world would be better place even better than dany's world but the problem here after the death of jon or dany if any of them ruled the children will rule after them and the children never going to have the hard life that their parents have been through to make them fit and thr kids are not like their fathers and some of them would be weak or cruel so the better world than dany seeks will go worse in a seconds after the rule of unfit son, and in GOT the history repeats it self in alot of matters because if we go back to the time of aegon the conqueror we can see that he was a great king after he ruled he only wants peace of the realm and everyone feared him and loved him at the same time but the moment he died his son aenys became king and he was weak and everyone knew that from his poor decisions that he made after the rule and alot of wars happened in his time and he died because of the stress that made him ill and he was only 34 years old, so the point is the throne does not mean peaceful realm no matter what because of the king's children that are unfit to rule and the circle will continue.

"All my friends shit on me for my deep love for Theon. I totally get that he murdered some farm kids and betrayed the Starks, but his storyline makes me so sad for him. 

Yes the Starks treated him well, but they and the other northerners always made comments that he wasn't part of the Stark family all throughout S1. (I always think of the scene where he saves Bran's life and Robb gets mad at him for doing it, saying it's not his family.) Then he went home and his real family basically despised him for existing. Not to mention he had his dick chopped off. I also felt like he redeemed himself by '""saving""ù Bran and Rickon, saving Sansa, and (soon to be) saving his sister. 

I hate that he betrayed Robb and fucks up Winterfell but does anyone else out there still like him or am I just a weirdo?? I haven't found anyone else who has a soft spot for him like I do lol. ",SPOILER
"Im rewatching season 5 and I didn't really pick up on how depressed tommen became. He stopped eating when Margaery got locked up and then his mom got locked up and he literally just locked himself in his room and wouldn't talk to anyone.  
And Marcella kinda got sent off to some foreign city by herself as a little girl, and when she finally became comfortable with her future there, and had her first ever bonding moment with her real father, she gets poisoned for some petty revenge against her mom.

These two characters actually had potential in my opinion. I just think it's kind of a shame that they had to die off the way they did, right as we were getting to know them. They've been around since episode 1, I know they were really little kids but this season they finally started getting their own personalities. Idk, I just wish we could've seen a tommen-Marcella reunion, or that they were portrayed as well as the stark children. 
Just my honest opinion I suppose",SPOILER

"Random thought. In the S7 finale, during the big Dragon Pit meeting, Cercei says something that seems inconsistent. She agrees to the truce and asks Jon to stay neutral, and says something along the lines of ""I know Ned Stark's son will be true to his word"". 

This is odd because ever since Ned's death she has referred to him as a traitor & liar. Cercei obviously knows the truth that Ned was honorable and true, but she set forth a public narrative that he was a traitor.

So... is this a plot hole? Or is she at the point now where she just doesn't give a crap?",SPOILER

I now wonder if Bran was in control of Summer and ended up actually saving himself. When Bran first realizes he can control other living creatures he described it as feeing like a dream but more real. He always talks about dreaming of being in control of Summer while he is out hunting frequently. Just an interesting thought that came to mind! ",SPOILER

Now this is probably not a good representation of what all viewers truly think, but it just got me thinking that there is probably a range of opinion as to how good the next season will be.

If it's a son maybe Eddard, he did try to save Dany in season 1 but I doubt she'll ever find out. Aemon possibly, after the last Targaryen aside from Dany and Jon. Brandon too if he died in season 8. Rhaegar was already honored by the dragon so I doubt they'll name him that. 

Not sure what they'd name the child if it were a girl. Possibly Arya if she were to die, Lyanna, Daenerys, Cat was a bitch to Jon so no way they'd name their daughter after her.",SPOILER

I think this means that as soon as Jon has served his purpose he will die.  He can't age because he is literally dead.  

I also think Jon's direwolf foreshadows this ""ghost"" with red eyes=fire wight.",SPOILER
"Is the way that they have butchered many of the characters. Some main examples are changing Euron from a creepy guy that actually has an interesting and weird aura to Cersei's pet. Or how they have screwed up Tyrion by making him go from badass dwarf to dwarf that makes one liners every other minute.

However my biggest issue with ruining characters is Arthur Dayne. I hate the Tower of Joy scene because of what they did to him. They got rid of his legendary sword '""Dawn""ù and replaced it with two normal swords because a sword fight with 2 swords in the hand of one person is a hell of a lot cooler than one sword in the hands of a literal sword fighting god. 

I know almost all of you will disagree with me on this but I can't get over how poorly they did the Tower of Joy sword fight scene.",SPOILER

"Hi there game of thrones fans!

Some months ago I finished watching game of thrones myself. And like much of you here can relate I've watched way to many GoT theory videos on youtube. Now in order to prepare her for the final season, I finally got my girlfriend to watch the show. And I've been watching with her with some of those theories in mind. However, while we were watching just a random scene in a random episode a few things hit me at once, and I'm very curious what you might think about this endgame theory on Varys.

MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: only keep reading if you have seen everything from season 1-7

So I'm going to be assuming you as a reader are familiar with the most mean stream theories. Here is what I assume to be true: Tyrion is a Targaryen (Mad king raped his mother, Tywin knew) , Varys truly wants stability for the realm and the people, Jon is Aegon.

Now I would like to point out that Varys in the books talked about how he ""trained"" a perfect ruler. And to some people this seems to be either Jon, whom indeed is an amazing leader, or Danny, whom is growing stronger every day. But if Varys had the Iron Throne in store for Jon, where the hell was he, he never was around? Jon wanted some legitimacy and joined the wall for life, and nobody bothered to stop him. Strange.

And what about Danny? Varys left the capital in order to serve Danny better and supply her with advice(rs). However, when Robbert gave the order to kill the girl. Varys didn't object, he carried out the order, and when Ned called to cancel the assassination Varys didn't seem to be in much of a hurry. It was probably already done he said. Now it is possible that it was true at the time, as timelines don't have to be shown chronologically, however, it does raise some suspicion. What if it totally fitted Varys his agenda to have Danny killed, and he didn't mind at all? 

So I got thinking: what if, Tyrion is the one Varys has been grooming for the Iron Throne for the past 20 years? 

It makes perfect sense. Varys was around for Tyrion not for Danny and Jon. Jon was shipped off to the wall and Varys didn't bother. Danny was wanted dead, and Varys carried out the order. However, Varys was always there when Tyrion needed assistance, or aided him when he escaped death row. Also, Varys took Tyrion to Danny. He said in order to advice her. What if that was a lie, and he only brought him there to advice her so that Tyrion would get more experience at ruling? To get to know the lands of Essos? Tyrion is a smart and just man, totally fit for ruling. And I think Varys has more to do with that than Tywin did. 

To come back to the point earlier. Dannies claim to the throne is stronger. As she is a true born Targaryen. However, is Varys really the kind of guy to really care about that? Or does het just want to do what is good for the realm and put the best ruler on the throne? And if that is the case, how would he have reacted when Robert wanted her dead? The way he acted seems to perfectly fit this scenario.

Both Danny nor Jon never really have seen to get prepared to rule. However Tyrion has served as Hand of the King, Master of Coin, and has led men to battle. He understands diplomacy and is able to make the hard, selfsacrificing choices rulers need to make. It would be awesome if Varys was just preparing him, grooming him, only to reveal his true herritage only √°fter the usurpors are dethroned. Before that it would be too dangerous. 

Okay, I could go on for hours about how many things are consistent with this theory, but I'm curious what you guys think.  Is this plausible? Is this even a new theory (It is very possible I missed it, not as up to speed anymore nowadays) Do i miss some epic implications of this? Is there something that disproves all of this that I'm missing? I look forward to what you have to say!

"I've been wondering why the last few seasons of the show did not work as well as the first few and I kind of have a season.

A very good writing technique is letting the world develop around the characters and have the characters react to it with their own unique personality. The show writers did the opposite where they made the world work around the characters. What do I mean by this?  Dany convincing all the Dothraki to join her after killing their leaders and walking out of a flaming hut, from season 1, it was established that the Dothraki hated magic. Instead of doing that, they could have had Dany make an impressioned speech about Dothraki not accomplishing shit in the last few decades and how she plans to make men from the far west fear the Dothraki. Less flashy but it would make more sense.

Another problem is that all the characters have now become tropes instead of characters. This is related to my first point. Arya is now one of the most bad ass assassin. Dany is a good and fair Queen. Jon is the white washed protagonist that can't be faulted. Sansa is the girl who suffered but learned the art of deception and ruling. See, during the first few season of Game of Thrones, we didn't neccessarily think that about these characters, our opinions of the characters and their trop changed constantly in the first few seasons. But in the last few, it has been static.

The third problem is that the show writers try to make it so every ""good"" guy likes each other for the basis that they are on the same side. Dany is now a fair and good Queen so every good guy has to like her. I'll make a bet with someone but I bet you that when Sam Tarly meets Dany, he'll forgive her on the spot and say something like ""I understand you did what you had to do"". In reality, people hold grudges, If you kill someone's brother who is dear to someone, they will remember, and even though Sam didn't get along with his father there is some relation there. It's not about whether Dany did the right thing or not in the grand sceme of things, to Sam, she killed someone he cared for. Why I think Sam will just forgive Dany is because something similar has already happened. Dany forgiving Varys and instantly trusting him after Varys sent some assassins at her. Arya and Sansa having their whole spat in season 7 and then LF happened and it's like the whole fight between them never happened. Their dispute was actually interesting and made sense. The point I'm getting is, is that the show writers are trying to say ""You should like this character, and to convince you even more, look at all these other characters that like this character"". In Game of Thrones fashion, many characters should still have disputes, the history of westeros is littered with some person sleighting another and then for the other person to take bloody revenge.

Sorry, I know some of you are sick of the complaints about the last few seasons. But in reality, many people have become less invested in the show, even the critics gave the last few seasons a weaker score.  I still like the show but I didn't bother rewatching the last 4 seasons.",SPOILER
"If Bran is the Night King (as a lot of theories suggest) is possible that the war against the white walkers will end easly: will be sufficient to kill Bran. It is sad and cinic to say that, but kill Bran (due to the fact he is sick) is far more easy than killing the Night King. Maybe someone among the good characters (probabibly a Stark) could realize that Bran is the Night King and, after a little bit of drama ('""does it worth to save the world by killing my brother/a poor paraplegic?""ù '""Yeas because he is not anymore Who he was: he is just the Night King!""ù) will kill him.

"This is going to be a somewhat unpopular opinion, and I hope it makes for some good discussion. Let me tell you before hand that I am not a Frey apologist, but rather a Stark fan. My goal here is to analyze the situation that led up to the Red Wedding a bit.

Walder Frey agreed to let Robb Stark cross the bridge when Robb's uncle Edmure was being besieged at Riverrun and needed urgent assistance. Walder Frey took advantage of the situation in a very sneaky way, thereby establishing one of his daughters as future Queen in the North.

When Walder Frey agreed to the deal, Renly Baratheon has already established himself in Highgarden, amassing a force of 100,000 men. Renly Baratheon was in a position that would have ensured a bloody war with the Lannister forces supporting Joffrey, thereby allowing the North and the Riverlands to split away from the Iron Throne. Walder Frey also knew that, considering Lysa Arryn was Robb's aunt, the Vale would either do nothing or take up arms for the Stark cause.

Joining Robb Stark was a safe bet at the time. When Balon Greyjoy started his invasion of the North (contrary to popular thought Theon was not the reason for this - at least in the books Balon was amassing a fleet for a long time already), and when Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell, confidence in Stark leadership in the North was shaken. Everybody knew that Robb had to deal with the Ironmen at some point, thereby exposing the Riverlands to further Lannister attacks.

When Renly was assassinated by the shadow, causing the Tyrells to defect to the Lannister side of the war, in turn causing Stannis to lose at the Blackwater, Robb Stark's fate was sealed. As Renly was dead and Stannis was militarily impotent post-Blackwater, Walder Frey had to expect a combined Lannister-Tyrell assault on the Riverlands. Robb Stark would have been busy fighting the Ironmen in the North, while this happened.

Walder Frey would have been beheaded as a traitor once the Riverlands fell to Lannister control.

**I think he did not have any other viable choice other than turning against Robb Stark.** The way he did it, first offering them bread and salt under his roof and thereby protection under guest right, and then killing them regardless, was highly dishonorable. No doubt about that, and I am not trying to justify that at all. I am merely saying that, in the mid-term, he would have turned against Robb Stark. And that leaves the following question: **Why didn't Robb Stark anticipate his betrayal, given the strategic situation of the war?** ",SPOILER
"He tells Jon that he has 6,000 men when they meet before the battle. Where are those 6,000 men from? Common northerners? There's no way the Boltons had that many allies.
Also, if they are just northerners, why would they fight for someone who is fighting against Sansa and Jon, the children of the Starks?
Might be a dumb question, just need some help understanding. ",SPOILER
"Wasn't  the gold that was going to be used to pay the bank attacked by the dragon? We saw the dragon burn some carriages during the attack in 7x4 I think. This could be a major plot point because cerci thinks she has paid back the bank and she thinks they will supply a army. But it turns out she didn't so the bank finds it is in their best interest to help against the great battle to hopefully win (a gamble) which is ironic and get back their gold. Because how else would they get it back if everyone is dead? It's in their best interest. Or maybe the great war finishes with jon winning etc etc and they have no men left, cerci didn't help. She goes in to finish it but in comes the gold banks army with the ships of that one dude to get their gold back. The fleet of men that went to go get the army have been killed as revenge. The gold bank sees cerci as the enemy for the vast debt and destroys her. ",SPOILER
"Ok. Had a really crazy idea, and I'm not even sure if this makes any sense, but I wanted to post it in case anyone else out there wants to think about it and further ponder...or speculate. Also, if there ends up being any truth to it- I don't want to be that person who says '""OMG that's what *I* was thinking all along!""ù and not have any proof.  I am aware this is probably WAY far-fetched and therefore these ideas are mostly for entertainment value, but I wanted to share regardless. 

In the books, there's a lot of talk about warging, and skin-changing. There's a line in the books in which Varamir Six-Skins asks how can we tell if the man is warged into the beast, or the beast is '""wearing the man""ù- something to that extent. Later on, on the show, we see Leaf shoving a dragon glass dagger into who we believe to be the first NK and turning him from human to White Walker. We don't see what happened before this. WHAT IF Leaf was really turning him BACK to his true form? What if he was WARGED into a human and was changed back to the NK (his true form) by Leaf against his will? What if the NK was the beast who was ""wearing the man""? 

Another thought: Eye color is mentioned very frequently in the book series. A common Targaryen trait is violet eyes. What if they are the descendants of WW's that are living almost parasitically via warging into humans? Don't red and blue make purple? Could a blue-eyed WW have warged into a red-eyed Targaryen ancestor and caused their eyes to turn violet? Could it have been instant, or could it have taken place over generations? We have already heard stories of humans pairing up with WW's (13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and the Night's Queen). Could this have happened to humans in other parts of the world, perhaps knowingly or unknowingly pairing with a WW wearing a human skin, then producing violet-eyed children? 

Final thought:  Targs have a history of being crazy. It is known. In the beginning of the series Old Nan states WW's hate anything with warm blood flowing through them. Taking my somewhat crazy theory into account- what if during the war, the WW's (as their bodies died) warged into humans, forgot who they were over time, and drove those humans crazy as a result? Could this explain the Targaryen propensity for insanity?Why are Targs associated with fire and heat? Is that what keeps the WW's inside them at bay?  

One more thing: They say the WW's were DEFEATED, but they never used the word killed. Could some of the original WW's have survived to stay in their true form, only needing human hosts to continue living? Maybe that's why Craster's babies turn to WW's at just the touch of The Others. Maybe that's how the WW's transfer/warg into them. 

No clue how to put this all together...but wanted to share.  Feel free to interpret any way you would like.  I'm not claiming I whole-heartedly believe any of this, I'm just passing time, wondering ""WHAT IF?"" while waiting for Season 8. Thanks for reading.

"So I'm looking through a few videos via YouTube.... and I keep hearing during the battles amongst dragon riders that there are rules. 

1.You can only bond to one dragon at a time. 

2. The dragon will only accept one rider until the rider dies, then will then allow a new rider.

3. The rider must have true Valyrian blood. For example, a Targaryan. 

Does this imply that the NK is potentially a Targaryan? Does his magic void this? Does his magic make up the difference? Or is it simply because Viserion has died and doesn't have any issue because he's a zombie? 

Idk just a thought. Maybe a clue hidden in plain sight? Let me know what you think ",SPOILER
"I happened to recently watch the TV series over again, I was very intrigued with Varys disliking R'hllor followers and magic as a whole.   


On 2 separate occasions Varys traded words with priestesses of R'hllor. The first time was with Kinvara and she asked him ""Should I tell you what the voice said? Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?""   


The second time was with Melisandre at Dragonstone and she said ""I have to die in this strange country, just like you.""

So my theory is Varys knows exactly what the voice from the fire said. I think it revealed his death to him or told him how he is going to die, hence why he seemed so shocked to find out Melisandre knew what it said. That could be the main reason for his hate of magic. Almost similar to how Jojen knew exactly when he was going to die and how.  


Im not quite sure how Varys's story will end but im open for all discussions.",SPOILER

"First of all, there will be spoilers and I don't know if someone has made the same theory before.
Second, sort of hopes someone proves me wrong. 

In season 6 and 7 the build up of two great and ¬´good¬ª houses has been shown. Targaryen and Stark. These two houses has been portrayed as the ones who will save the realm and make it prosper, but GRRM has said himself that he don't likes good endings where the hero(es) wins and everyone lives happily ever after. 

The Hidden Rise of Petyr Littlefinger Baelish.
Littlefinger told Sansa that he likes to play a game. A game where imagines what is the wors thing someone will do to him. When Bran quoted Littlefinger, he knew he was in trouble. 
In of the episodes before Sansa asked Littlefinger if he knew what the Faceless men were, and he answered only by reputation. We all know that is a lie, because someone who ¬´cheats¬ª death and can look like others is of interest to a person who have had an eye on the throne. 
So in one of the episodes in S7 we see him talking to a woman in Winterfell and gives her a coin. Probably a Coin of Bravos. Then on the trial, there are TWO options in which he escaped.

Option one: He learned from Jaqen H'gaar and faked his death. We have seen Arya ¬´kill¬ª Jaqen H'gaar and the she proceeds to take of his many faces. He then appears live and well. Littlefinger may have done the same.

Option two: The lady who was given a coin from Littlefinger in Winterfell copied his face and took his place on the trial. You may be wondering: ¬´but you can only use the face to a dead person.¬ª WRONG. In the same episode where Arya ¬´kills¬ª Jaqen H'gaar, she pulls of his many faces and stares at her own face and then Jaqen H'gaar appears. So we know some of the higher ranks of the Faceless can use faces to the living. 

If one of the two options is correct or a third option will be put to use, how will he succeed?
Littlefinger have been in the game for quite some time. So he knows how dangerous sitting on the iron throne really is, and he can't defeat all those massive armies. He will wait for everyone else to fight and he will corrupt the winner from the shadows. He will then continue to play the game and rule the kingdoms from the shadows, and everyone and everything will then be puppets to Littlefinger and rule in his own way. 

Doesn't seem so farfetched, right?",SPOILER

"During the scene where Cersei blows up the wildfire under the sept, I've always wondered why she had the young girl lead Lancel Lannister down into the wildfire chamber beneath the sept. The girl stabs him, but he was literally just a couple of feet/seconds away from putting out the candle and ruining Cersei's entire plot. Him and his men would have died in the blast, so I don't understand the point of bringing him down to the chamber, unless it was purely for dramatic effect. Any thoughts?",SPOILER
"So, at one point Melisandre was seen as her normal self in the bath, without her necklace on

But then, in season 6 episode 1, when she takes the necklace off she turns old.

So.. is it the necklace that keeps her young, or am I completely wrong and it's just like.. her own magic that does it? I dunno",SPOILER

"Something that has been bothering me for time immemorial is the fact that there are certain houses in Game of Thrones that are just under appreciated and are far too hated to be blanked or appreciated by the fan base in general. As a serious fan of Game of Thrones and the Song Of Ice And Fire series I have found numerous houses that are far too amazing to get the ending that they have received. I love George RR Martin as much as the next Game of Thrones fan however there is a serious criticism that I must give.  
Houses that are uniquely cruel and are 100% Game of Thrones are some of the most squandered storylines in the entire series.  
My very favorite house that has been damaged the most  is House Bolton. The Boltons are uniquely cruel they are impressively power hungry and they are stuck in a limbo of uncertainty and Extinction. The Boltons have one of the most unique models and sigils in the entire series and yet they are treated as though they were just another villain that happened to stop by. The same could be said about numerous other houses that are much more popular and bigger than the Boltons. Such as the Starks and the Lannisters. These houses have not so much been harmed by outside forces but have been harmed by either too much ambition or too little ambition. Similar things could be said about the Baratheons and the Tyrells.  
However this post is about houses that are mostly hated. houses like the Boltons, like the Lannisters and in my case like the Targaryens.  
I think it's about time that we as fans finally put aside the idea that we can only focus on houses that we enjoy. I think it's time that we look at the more hated and awful houses in the series not only for inspiration but for admiration as well.",SPOILER
"I haven't heard much of any talk about Essos In the endgame.. 

Does Winter come in Essos? Why don't they just go to Mereen and build a larger army there? Obviously it goes against the show and the interest of having a great batter for Westeros, but surely there must a logical reason for them not to go there. 

And if the WW and AotD take over Westeros, would they go to Essos next? ",SPOILER
"Mance offered Jon Snow peace in exchange for passage south of the wall.  Stannis offered the same, and pardons, citizenship, land, etc. except he also needed them to fight.  Except he specifically wanted Mance to bend the knee. Which Mance refuses to do.

However, if the original offer to Jon had been made and they were allowed south of the wall before Stannis showed up (or even if Stannis never showed up).  Did Mance expect to remain a separate king and the free folk to take land from others for themselves?  Or did he plan on his people becoming citizens of Westeros, and thus being subordinate to the Iron Throne?

My point is that either way, unless Mance Rayder wanted to seize land south of the wall and try to set up a separate kingdom, he would have had to acknowledge the ruler on the Iron Throne (or in other words, he'd have had to bend the knee, at least metaphorically if not physically as well).

And if that's true, why would he be willing to live in someone else's kingdom one minute but then when Stannis shows up he won't do it?

"Ok so I will begin with season 1 and 2 she has the Cersei hairstyle.

Now this is just a thought that everyone she copied has or will die. Margery and Catlyn are dead. Cersei will die because of the valonqar prophecy. And I think Danaerys will die too all because of the season 8 teaser, it's very similar to Danaery's hair.

"Okay, so there are two known ways to kill a white walker, Dragon glass and Valyrian Steel. The white walker army is coming fast and Jon goes to Dragonstone to talk to Daenerys about mining Dragon glass. Bran is in Winterfell by the end of season 7. The army of the dead is coming fast and Bran knows that more than anyone. It would make sense that the day he came back he should use his powers as the three eyed raven and try to work with blacksmiths to forge Valyrian Steel so they can mass produce it in Westeros. Yeah, it could be really expensive and hard or impossible to make but they should at least try. There are probably less than 10 known Valyrian Steel swords, so even doubling that would make the war a lot easier to fight. This could still happen in season 8, but it should've been his first priority as soon as he got back to Winterfell because it doesn't look like they have a lot of time.

TLDR: Bran should find how to make Valyrian Steel in order to fight the army of the dead.",SPOILER
"Probably not an accident that Valyrians crafted weapons that could survive contact with WW weapons. And of course, kill them as well.

Are there any theories that attempt to explain the connection?

As a random guess, maybe the Valyrians were descendents of the First Men who abandoned the continent and took the risk of controlling dragons to prevent Essos from also falling into ruin. This would help explain both the affinity for dragons and the unusual properties of their swords.

"My understanding is that the Kingsguard are responsible for the protection of the monarch and his/her family. With only seven members this seems rather unrealistic. King Robert had three children plus Cersei meaning 7 guys had to protect 5 people around the clock. 

In addition we see Prince Joffrey with his own bodyguard, the Hound, who is not a KG at that time. Plus, we see a few scenes where Queen Cersei is accompanied by Lannister men-at-Arms (power is power scene) and not Kingsguard.

What's the deal? Surely in reality the Kingsguard should be either much larger like a Royal Guard or else only protect the monarch, with additional knights for other royals? ",SPOILER
"It's an odd question i know,but i recently reread ""A Class of Kings"" and was reminded of how much i love the Theon chapter where she meets Asha. That whole chapter where you are introduced to this cool chick and you think it's just another random character,but then realise who she actually is was really cool. It was fun at many moments,serious at others,you learn more about the Ironborn and then the reveal was very unexpected. I normally don't like the Ironborn stuff that much but that was one of my favorite chapters of the whole second book.

Another great introductory scene was that of Tyrion in the show getting a blowjob and having a drink before Jaime comes in the room. It was funny,encapsulated Tyrion's personality perfectly and made him instanly likeable.",SPOILER

The opposite of the Clegain Bowl will happen. The Hound and the Mountain will fight together to save the world!!!!!!!!!!",SPOILER
"I feel like I'm missing something on my rewatch. How was Margaery's initial arrest justified? Just because the one guy knew of Loras' birthmark on his upper thigh doesn't mean his accusation of her knowing is true, right? Outside of the tattoo and Loras attacking the guy, what he said about Margaery is still just word of mouth and honestly quite a ridiculous thing to arrest the queen for. 

Edit: I just watched this episode. I'm aware of the scene it took place in. I'm simply asking how it was sufficient evidence to arrest Margaery because some random person who slept with his brother says she knew. 

If that's the case why don't people just always accuse people/houses, maybe even the high sparrow of being gay and paying a witness to say they witnessed it. There would be literally no difference, except it's more ridiculous in this case because it's the queen. ",SPOILER

Bad endings
1: If after eveything deanerys sits the throne. This might just be cause i dont like the character  but i also think its to textbook for a show like GoT.

"I have watched again all the seasons, I still don't understand why Jon is a Targaryen and a legitime son if he:

\-will have a child with Daenerys;

\-will die.

He has accomplished everything by being Ned Stark's bastard son: Lord Commander, King in the North, Daenerys' lover. There was no need to make him a Targaryen. Jon Snow has achieved the feat of being accepted by all for his merits despite his bastardy. He even being loved by a powerful queen. He could thus have united North and South by marrying Daenerys, having a child and so on.

Except no, George RR Martin has made Jon a Targaryen, Daenerys' nephew and a serious contender for the iron throne.

Why ?

Jon received a Stark education and incest is a serious sin. He is a man of honor, he surely can't abandon his honor, his morals and his education to continue a relationship with his aunt. If he can not lie to Cersei for the good of humanity, I imagine he can't continue a relationship with his aunt, especially if it has just begun. In addition, the author strongly denounces incest and reminds us of the problems that entails (madness ...). How can Jon & Daenerys have a child if we do not know what will become of him in 20 years?

Then, Daenerys always believed to be the legitimate queen. She killed people and took control of territories based on this right. If Jon has the same right, it's a problem. It calls into question her convictions, her decisions, her actions and her sovereignty. In addition, some people followed her thinking that. But if another pretender appears, there is a risk of division. Not to mention the fact that Jon & Daenerys do not have the same vision of things, nor the same education. We are not in a nice story where everything is resolved by love / magic. This is a story where the title is about the games of the throne. The Jon & Daenerys relationship is one.

George RR Martin said he did not want to write a story with nice heroes against nasty villains. But more a story with gray characters who are the heroes of their own story and who end up opposing each other such Hector and Achilles. Choose our side becomes difficult because we know the 2 opponents and we are attached to them.

Which makes me say that season 8 is going to be hard to watch. We risk seeing the 2 main characters to oppose even if they are both the heroes of their story and thinks they are right.

I will also add that when I hear the showrunners, Kit & Lena joking about a Targaryen baby in the season 7 comments, I tell myself there is a concern. They can not talk so openly about a future spoiler. Unless... it does not happen.

And finally, if he does not end up with Daenerys and has no children with her, why should he die?

Why is he a Targaryen then? If he is, it is to perpetuate his lineage. Whether he ends up on the throne or not, the purpose of his identity is that he has a descendant. As Jorah puts it by passing on to him LongClaw.

&#x200B;

The fact that Jon is a legitimate Targaryen makes me think that the Jon & Daenerys relationship is likely to end, that they will not have a child together and that Jon, unless he has a legitimate child with someone else, will not die. But I see so many people thinking the opposite that I wonder if I'm the only one thinking that.

This maybe a dumb question but I have been thinking about it lately. If the living were to lose the battle against the White Walkers would they then try to travel beyond the narrow sea?

she wanted to run away with tyrion at some point, if she was in it for the money how did she think it would go with a dwarf on the run? on the other hand if she really loved him how can she simply switch gears and condemn him to death AND look him in the eye at the trial :O ""uh you send me away?

"Whoops, reposting this because I messed up where the spoiler tag went in the title.

I've been seeing a lot of these, here's how I think it will end. This got a bit long, but I would be happy if you read it and wanted to discuss! I will warn you that I am long winded and I have not read the books, although I have some amount of book knowledge just from being on here and reading some wikipedia articles.

**1. Humanity will defeat the Night King. I think that either Jon or Dany will survive the battle, but not both**

They might both survive, but I just doubt it. I know people say that it's still been a tragic journey, etc, but I feel like if the show ends with the 2 (potential) chosen ones : 
-discovering/being reunited with their family 
-falling in love 
-having a baby 
-becoming king and queen

...that's just a little bit Happily Ever After to be the ending that's been hinted at. And even though they'd surely lose friends along the way and possibly even Bran, it feels a little too neat.

I will admit that since we don't know exactly how long the books will go past the fall of the Night King, there is some potential for them both to survive and run into reality to complicate things. Or maybe it really will end with them going off into the sunset together. But I can't help but feel like they're going to get boatsexbaby just in time to save its remaining parent from being ""A Targaryan alone in alone in the world"".

**2. I think Jon will probably be the one to die, between the two of them**

So it's not much of a leap to think that the fight against the Night King and his army is related to magic coming back into the world. And given the man of the Night's watch had betrayed his vows after seeing the White Walkers at the very beginning of the series, that's probably the one that came first. So I think that both of our two potential chosen ones got something magical to use in their war against the Others, and when they win they're going to have to give it back.

Sadly (at least for me, because I love Drogon and Rhaegal) I think that for Dany, that means she's going to lose her dragons. Odds are she'll lose them in the fighting, but they'll turn the tide of war for humanity first.

For Jon, he was sent back because he still had a mission- to defeat the Night King. When he's completed that mission, it's not such a stretch to think that his borrowed time will be up. So I think he'll fall but bring the Night King down with him.

It makes sense, in a way. The magic was brought back to fight the Others, and when they are defeated, the magic is going to go back out of the world. Of course I don't think they'll be that textually explicit about why Jon and the dragons die, but it makes a sad poetic kind of sense.

**3. Arya will take care of Cersei**

In my estimation, Jon and Daenerys are the main protagonists, but Arya has had a lot of focus for a reason. She's had a long journey to become both an assassin but still Arya Stark, and she hasn't really done that much with it. In the books she wasn't even the one to kill the Freys. All of the ""original 5"" at this point sort of have their endgame arcs clear, except her.

Bran's journey has been about learning to access his visions, allowing them to discover how to defeat the Night King (I'm not convinced that the NK is going to be anything other than an unknowable evil). I suspect Jon is the prince that was promised, he was the first to rally men against the darkness and he will strike the killing blow. Daenerys finally understands why she has her dragons and how to use them in defense of the realm instead of to conquer it. Afterwards, when she assumes the Iron Throne and decides what kind of world she wants to make, Tyrion will be at her side to guide her. And after all these years of being sickened and ignored by shit rulers, he's finally found someone worth serving, that will appreciate his talents and listen to his counsel as they try to imagine how to structure a better world.

So that's nice, all tied up with a bow. So where does Arya fit it? I admit that having her be the one to take down Cersei is still kind of weak tea, especially after they defeat the Night King. But there's something to be said for killing without honor, especially when it allows one mad woman to die instead of untold innocents to starve in a lengthy siege or burn with wildfire. And maybe there'll be another role for this version of Arya that will tie in better that I'm not even considering.

**4. There isn't going to be an Iron Throne anymore**

So in this part, talking about what I think is going to happen after the wars I'm mostly assuming that Dany and her child live, but Jon doesn't. I think that most of this could almost just as easily work with Jon and their child, though, if Dany turns out to be the one who dies. Or even with both of them alive.

I think that once their enemies have been struck down and it is time to rule, Dany (and Tyrion) will restructure power in Westeros. Instead of a single King holding absolute power, it will be shared.

They will give some portion of it to the lords, some portion of it to the small folk, but still retain a more limited monarchy with a different chair. Maybe even something where each kingdom is given equal representation on the small council.

It won't be a mummer's monarchy, to be certain- the Queen will still rule. But there will checks on her powers, and she will hold herself accountable to the people she governs. I think that Daenerys and Tyrion will realize that if she assumes absolute power, no matter what good she does with it during her lifetime, if there's still an Iron Throne in play then it just takes one shitty descendent to undo all of it. Jaeherys I was what, 2 generations away from the Dance of Dragons? The only way to create sustainable change is to change the institutions. And that means letting go of the Iron Throne.

I do wonder how much time they'll take/have to explore things like how they handle victory. I think it will be hard for Daenerys to give up power, regardless of how well she knows it's for the long term good of the Realm. Especially in the midst of mourning her dragons, she's going to feel insecure, voluntarily weakening her position.

Personally, I find that I'd be more interested in that part of the story than watching the epic fight scenes, but I'm probably in the minority. Regardless of who lives, who dies, or who ends up with what kind of throne, I think that rebuilding Westeros in the aftermath of the Great War and all the other wars is going to be a difficult business.

Some things seem easy- certainly I hope and expect that Daenerys will do away with the Great Council of 101 AC. Other things are more difficult. If Sansa Stark and the North sue for independence, does she let them go? If they do, who goes next? Who, if anyone, should be installed in the numerous vacant seats of the once great and noble houses of Westeros?

Does she try to keep the Dothraki in Westeros, knowing that it will be an endless struggle to contain them, or does she send them back to Essos where they will probably go right back to their old ways? Is there any way for her to ensure her continued vision in Mereen without her dragons?

I don't need or expect the show to address any specific one of these questions- just to acknowledge that it gets even harder once the wars are won, especially for a conqueror.

**5. It's time for the Age of Men in Westeros**

This one I'm a little hesitant about. I don't think the entire planet instantly drained of anything magical the second the Night King fell, especially in places like Old Valyria. But I do think that it's going to be draining out of the world, and in its wake will coincide a new era for men, where they can establish greater traditions than might makes right. I'm hesitant about this because it sounds just like Tolkien, and I feel like GRRM must surely have something planned besides that.

That said, I'm not sure how else this ends. At the end of the day as far as I can see it boils down to either:

1. Night King wins
2. Jon and/or Dany win and set up their kingdom in a way that preserves Targaryen Exceptionalism and starts the whole Fire and Blood shitshow up again.
3. Jon and/or Dany win and weaken the throne in order to move Westeros more towards a system that would be resilient against being subdued by an unjust monarch.
4. Humans win but all the likely candidates to take and hold the throne are dead, so Westeros devolves right back into 7 or more warring kingdoms, each with their own little lord that thinks this is his moment to seize power.

Anyways. I recognize that there are lots of other ways it could go, but I feel like this one is the most likely. I don't really like it though.",SPOILER
"Since it was announced that season 8 would have mostly 80-minute episodes, I've seen a lot of people getting very, very upset and entitled. Many people are kicking off, claiming that we've been misled, that these runtimes aren't what we were told to expect, and more. But there's one fact these people are forgetting; we were never told we would have a season of 2-hour episodes. Not once.

The only quotes I can find online state that some episodes may be feature length, and one that actually says exactly this;¬†*'""We haven't had that discussion yet because I don't know how long the episodes are going to be. Two hours per episode seems like it would be excessive, but it's a great show, so who knows?""ù Casey Bloys.*

And we *are* having feature length episodes. Two thirds of the episodes are as long as a movie each, albeit a movie that's on the shorter side of the scope. For a fantasy show with a cast, budget, and production scale as large as this, we should actually consider ourselves damn lucky that we're still getting this much despite the increasing scope of the show. This is a massive step up from the lengths of previous average episodes; pretty much a 50% increase.

I remember when this whole 2-hour episode thing started, and it's literally down to nothing other than fans taking that previous quote I mentioned, getting ridiculously over-excited with it, and creating their own expectation that we would have 2-hour episodes. This kind of thing needs to stop. It's a perfect example of people over-hyping season 8 to the point where it simply won't live up to our expectations, and this reaction has proved that.

Basically, I'm not entirely sure what the point of this post is other than to rant. D&D are getting so much shit right now from entitled brats who seem to be forgetting that they're still delivering us the biggest fantasy TV show that has ever graced TV. How about we start, I don't know, actually fully appreciating this amazing show and all the work that's gone into it? Sounds like a good plan to me.

TLDR: We were never actually told we would get 2-hour episodes - it's just some fans taking quotes out of context and building up unreasonable expectations out of over-excitement, spreading this all over the internet, then getting entitled when these unrealistic expectations aren't met.

Note: I included a spoilers tag simply because I've tried posting non-spoiler things on here before that have been rejected still for not having that tag.",SPOILER
"The war against the undead is going to have most nobles either killed or fleeing while they still can to Essos.

How likely is for the Houses to keep feudalism going after the literal apocalypse coming their way?

If humanity wins, would the survivors try kingdoms again? Would they even be able to opress the masses?

My theory is that most survivors will be isolated from each other, kind of like city states that will develop a federation style government.

"I think the writers are going to give us an unexpected king and queen at the end of the HBO GOT story.  They'll take 2 characters that we don't expect and unite them as the king and queen.  Both characters will do something exceptional to justify their elevation to become king and queen.  My guess is Gendry will forge a dragon glass tipped spear and will launch it from another dragon killing device that Qyburn will build.  Gendry will kill the Night King's dragon during the great battle with the Night King.  

Arya will take the face of a White Walker so she can get close enough to the Night King to kill him with the Valyrian dagger.   Gendry's and Arya's marriage will unite House Stark and House Baratheon which will be acceptable for the Seven Kingdoms.  Daenerys and Jon will die in the battle so they won't be alive to become king and queen.  Since they are related anyway, that would not work out well for a marriage.  In addition, Daenerys marrying Jon would be too predictable and the HBO GOT writers will want to avoid that type of ending.     ",SPOILER

"So as we all saw when Littlefinger got sentenced to death Sansa told the room that it was him who killed Lysa. The Vale only followed him (and Sansa because of him) due to his marriage to Lysa. 

In Season 4 when Lysa died the Knights of the Vale were ready to kill little finger for her murder, the only reason they didn't is because Sansa lied for him and agreed with his story, that she did infact commit suicide.

We were shown before this how loyal the Vale were to the Aryn family, the Knights worshipped them and would do anything for them. They end up following littlefinger because he has a hold over Robin. 

Will these men honestly stay following the Starks now they have found out that Sansa played a huge part in covering up this murder? Can we even expect the show to cover this aspect of the plot? 

I am honestly interested in people's opinions on this matter, can we really say Sansa is coming into her own and learning to play the game when her first bold move will alienate one of their largest allies. Do you think the Knights of the Vale will stand by the Starks after this?

However I recalled that when fire and ice meet in the S8 teaser, it appears the location is at The Neck, and a wall of dragonglass forms. Some speculate this implies this is where the 'final stand' against the White Walkers will take place because of that, and also the Necks strategic geography. No one has been able to invade the North because of the Neck and Moat Cailin. Wouldn't it be fitting then to reverse this, and the White Walker's can't invade the South because of the Moat?

"How would you play your hand from here?

My plan would be dragon focused:

1. Stop having sex with brother for a few weeks/months to put together a plan
2. Plan consists of mass producing scorpions to secure the cities and shipping lanes
3. Continuous testing on various bolt designs. Hollowpoints, poison tipped etc
4. Support with modified seige weaponry, also testing experimental ammunition. Does wildfire finish a downed dragon or just make it stronger? Starving brother has to find this out for me if he hopes to ever get any again.

&#x200B;

Here is the key for all this: I'm not looking to actually kill the dragon, but force it into the fringes.

If the dragon has to take huge risks in battle it can not reign free like it did in the Lannister battle. That returns power to manned armies and brings the Lannisters back into a somewhat even matchup.

Scorpions and modified seige weapons do become a target to defend though, adding to the complexity for field commanders.

Why would I think that? 

Some people have said it is interesting that the Season 8 trailer left Bran out. I think they did not, that was Bran as the Night King coming to meet Jon, Sansa and Arya in the crypts. The hint is the freezing raven feather.

Bran clearly had some connection with the Night King when he was touched by the Night King. The Night King twice left Sam alive, Sam and Bran have become friends. Bran was fortold that he would never walk again but he would fly, that is him flying on the resurrected dragon. Bran is also responsible for making King Aerys II Targaryen into the Mad King by breaking his mind like he did to Hodor trying to warg into him for some reason, maybe trying to get him to destroy all the dragon eggs stored in Kings landing. After that fails Bran is left with a last option of warging into the Night King where he will get stuck.

Dany's 3 eggs were not the only dragon eggs in the world, they were rare and precious like big gemstones, but not unheard of. There were dragon skeletons in Kings landing, I am certain there would also be eggs there. Wildfire could hatch the dragon eggs, and no viewer/reader would want to see Cersei with an army of dragons. Cersie would never team up with Jon and Dany to fight anything and Jon's whole army couldn't stand a week against the white walker army. Jon has already teamed up with the Wildlings, his former enemies - that is his MO.  Qyburn was very interested in the undead hand, his ambitions far exceed just the Mountain's resurrection.",SPOILER
"I'm rewatching GoT and have been reminded of something. In the earlier seasons, you didn't really know who to root for. Rob Stark attacks the Lanisrers, well I like both Rob and Tyrion so I don't really know which side I want to win. Stanis vs Kings landing: I was on Stanis's side, but still didn't want Tyrion to die. I liked Stannis, but got goosebumps when Breanne executed him.
I could go on, but my point is that this system made conflicts much more engaging and it has changed.

Now it's Denerys (not looking up spelling) and Jon vs the white walkers and Cersie (still not looking it up). It just doesn't feel the same. Everything is so clear cut. Good vs evil. It just doesn't have the same gravity as before. It feels to by the numbers. Am I the only one that feels this way?",SPOILER

"This may sound like a strange one. No, I am not some kind of pervert ""ì basically my parents want to watch the show, which is great, however I would like to rewatch it with them but am really not looking forward to sitting through all the sex and nudity in their presence. That would be extremely awkward.

So in order to forewarn myself of these scenes, I was wondering if anyone could somehow supply me with a list of all the sex/nudity scenes in the show, including:

- the season and episode
- the time stamp
- what's going on in the scene (some nudity I might be able to sit through, but Cersei and Jaime going at it? Nah)

I know it might be a big ask, but thanks to anyone who can help!

If this is not possible, it would be great to hear from people who have watched the show with their parents. How awkward did you find it?

Edit: Some people are getting the wrong idea. I'm not going to skip these scenes, I'm going to make myself scarce. Y'know, make a cup of tea or go to the bathroom.

Edit 2: Yeah I thought every scene might be a long shot. Even just the more graphic sex scenes would help.",SPOILER
"Sorry for the obscure and vague title, i didn't wanna spoil anything, I'm not super active here so i wasn;t sure how I should phrase the title.

Anyhoo, in this clip GRRM mentions that Dany (or Emilia Clark anyway) is on location in Spain. Check it out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X_0PSvGhvc

Does this mean that Dany goes to Dorne? The video itself is new, but the interview might be older so it is possible that he's reffering to a previous season's shooting, especially since shooting on eight is almost certainly wrapped. But Slaver's bay was shot in Morocco (also discussed in the video), whereas we know that Dorne was filmed in Spain.

The only logical conclusion i can make is that Dany goes to Dorne in season eight. Whyfore? Maybe to resurrect her alliance with the Dornishmen?

"Too many fan theories have already made all of us to believe that Night King could be a Stark or Brandon Stark himself. Additionally few more die hard fans are now rooting for White Walkers and the one true and (possibly) undefeated leader in the world of ASOIAF aka Night King. What i believe is very simple and it can actually unravel the myths about Night King and why White walkers are back after 8000 years after they were defeated in the Long Night.

&#x200B;

Before i start let me help you recall few things happened in the TV series. Samwell Tarly wasn't killed by White Walkers. The White Walker showed him mercy, second time at the Hardhome Night King was looking into the eyes of John Snow, obviously he was looking with optimism(so many theories are already there about it but none is convincing enough). Third at John Snow's suicide mission Night King can easily kill a dragon but he did nothing against the John's men. He could've easily killed each one of them with his spears. But that's not them they don't kill people on purpose. They didn't hurt Sam because he was innocent and pure heart person just like the Night King himself. Second, John is the key to everything and Night King knows about it that he is his only hope. I will break it later.

&#x200B;

Lets come to the main part of the theory, i believe Night King is too powerful to lose and no\_one can defeat him. He hasn't come to conquer but he has come to offer solution and real peace in the Realm. He was wandering in far North with his White Walkers and protecting the realm of man from themselves, because we know he was made to kill mankind by children of forest but he is man himself and part of him never wants to kill another human. The man who was turned into first White walker by Children of Forest was actually betrayed by Children and turned into deadly evil.  He was there to offer peace at the first place and his heart was pure and the purity is still living in him that is why he wasn't killing people in all these years. The magic is back to seven kingdoms since we start watching the  things on HBO premium. The dragons are back, Warlocks, White Walkers, Dire Wolfs(which are magical creatures too and far more important than dragons and too many things have are happening once again. Night King knows it is the time and that is why they are back. They want to get rid of their miserable life and wants to come back to real life. They are the only protector of realm, and they can do so by killing themselves and killing all the magic with them, so one race can't have superiority on another in ASOIF worlds, Targaryen used dragon(magical creature) to rule over the other races and control the resources and law. Just like Thanos, Night King also wants balance and it can only be achieved if magic can be ended. so far we have seen the destruction caused by the magic, souls were burn alive by Red Priestess, genitals of man/children were used for magical spells, faceless man are using black magic from centuries and don't forget first White Walker was created by magic itself. So, if White Walkers die all the magic will die with them, resulting in the balance in the realm(who is the protector of realm now). Its the Night King.

&#x200B;

Coming to the point why White walkers are back now and what is possibly going to happen next. Everyone knows John and Night King has a special connection and so does the Bran and the Night King. So, here is the catch John is way more magical creature than anyone else in the ASOIF, he had defeated one God already.....God of Death and he is way too lucky(it is magic again) than any other character in Game of Thrones. He is a special Child possessing the magical powers of  Starks and Targaryens.  Night King knows everything about him (as he is Greenseer and more powerful than Three Eyed Raven) and John with the help of Bran can defeat him and put an end to his miserable life. Don't forget he still feels like human and he is in great pain, which is his real power. His weakness is his power. But the only problem with hm is the Dragon Glass, which i think is behind the birth of Dragons also, he can't overpower the magical abilities of the dragon glass and he is controlled by it. He has to get rid of dragon glass and i don't know how but John with help of Bran will help him getting rid of dragon glass. So, he is back because John is born and Bran is there to help his brother. The Night King himself wanted to be defeated for the survival of mankind.",SPOILER
"Anyone think there will be any repercussions for Theon taking Winterfell from Bran.  When he knew Bran was helpless and alone in season 2?  I mean at this point, its a moot point, and probably wont mean much in the final season and everything they need to sort out.  I know Theon has been through a lot since season 2, but I could see Arya avenging Bran.  ",SPOILER
"What are some tactics that Jon could have actually used, that would have greatly reduced the Stark casualties in the Battle of the Bastards?",SPOILER
"In the first episode Ned says, ""The man who passes the sentence must swing the sword"". Robb also mentions it when he kills Rikard Karstark. John also lives up to this and swings the sword in his executions as Lord Commander. I think the only example of a Stark not following this is Arya killing littlefinger after Sansa passes the sentence. In fact, Illyn Payne killing Ned may be the only other example of the sentencer not being the executioner, though I may be wrong. What is the reason for this? Girls having never been taught this by Ned? Sansa learning from Geoffrey in Kings Landing? Something else?",SPOILER
"During a life or death fight I'm sure it's everything. But as a matter of rank, profession, wealth, how much does it matter?

Jaime didn't seem to lose much after losing his hand.

He, Selmy and Dayne were Kingsguards. I'm not sure how powerful that role is alone but it seems like a 6/10 at best (You know what Tywin says about it).

King Robert would be a good mention for the other side of the argument. In his case I wonder if he could have just rented a few more unsullied or golden company to do even better from afar.

Is swordsmanship really powerful, perhaps a fast lane to the traditional powers in this world? Or is it more of a stick measuring contest?",SPOILER
"I understand if you like her when appealing to things like savagery or edginess, but I keep seeing far too often all these fanatics all over the internet or in real life who actually empathize with her and and think she's actually a sympathetic person, like ""Oh poor Cersei, she is so misunderstood, got cheated on by Robert, been neglected by Jamie, and she does nothing but love her children. It's not fair everything what happened to her!"" I mean, are you kidding me? Everything she has done she has brought on herself with her own selfishness, narcissism, hatred, and arrogance. She becomes even more psychopathic later on in the series. I'd go so far as to rank her right behind Joffrey and Ramsay in terms of evil.

&#x200B;

Again, it's understandable if you like her because you think she's cool or edgy, but to think she's this sympathetic poor misunderstood character with great moral potential is just irrational.",SPOILER
"One of the biggest elephants in the room at Castle Black in early seasons is that the wall is desperately undermanned.  Once it became clear that the dead were rising (this was generally accepted as shown by the practice of burning bodies being routine), and that White Walkers were returning, there is an obvious solution:  instead of the Battle of Castle Black, couldn't someone have offered Mance Rayder's group the possibility of occupying the abandoned castles in exchange for pledging their support to defending the wall?  Probably would have had to have someone else besides the Thenn evacuate the northernmost villages, but that would have been far less bloody than what happened, and in the end the defenses would be at full strength again.  Mance wouldn't even have to bend the knee to any King, lose any men fighting the formidable Castle Black even if victory was assured, and even if they formally were commanded by Castle Black, by strength of army he would be the strongest power at the wall.  Strong incentive for him to accept.

I think I have to blame Lord Commander Mormont.  He was right to bring a force north of the wall--but instead of having Jon kill him and engage in espionage, he should have let them be taken and made such an offer directly to Mance.   A similar idea comes up later, but it seems like it should have been made much sooner, and while Mance was still alive to provide unity.

Maybe Jon would have thought of it while negotiating with Mance, if Stannis hadn't arrived just then.",SPOILER
"My thoughts are the Mountain, Red Viper and Sir Barriston Selmy! ",SPOILER
"Bran(The Three Eyed Raven) is going to tell Jon who is real parents are and could possibly see ways to defeat the white walkers how man did way back when. Maybe could see how they built the wall. I'd say their only way to win the great war is with ""wild fire"", because after all Jon and Daenerys are Targaryens. I don't see any other way they could possibly win. This makes sense also because ""Brandon The Builder"" who originally built the wall was also the founder of House Stark. 
",SPOILER
"I don't understand why everybody complains about how quickly travel happens in later seasons. Now, I understand the show and the books were built off of the traveling, sense of urgency, and how time was of the essence, but the idea that the show has never taken liberties with traveling is absurd. In Season 1 Episode 2 Catelyn Stark is in the Godswood of Winterfell discussing the Lannister plot. In the very NEXT episode she's in King's Landing. Even if it's more apparent now, it was always there.

TLDR: The show's been taking liberties with travel time since Season 1",SPOILER
"...destroyed Ned Stark's Valyrian greatsword, Ice, so that he could forge two smaller Valyrian swords. Valyrian swords are rare (~200 in the 7 kingdoms, according to the books) and I'm sure their value doesn't scale linearly with size. If a 50cm Valyrian sword was worth X, a 1m Valyrian sword would be worth more than 2X.

Ice was probably one of the largest remaining Valyrian swords, so Tywin breaking it down to get two average swords seems like a terrible business decision. It doesn't seem to fit Tywin's character either, seeing as he's supposed to be an economical man. Ice was probably exponentially more valuable than the sum of the two new swords.

It's a shame, kind of always bothered me that Ned's sword was reforged.",SPOILER
"I'm rewatching Season 1 currently, and I was reminded of the exact moment I began to hate Cersei. I really hope that Arya gets to kill Cersei, because she made Ned kill Lady. Lady didn't do anything! She wasn't even there, and everyone knew it, but Cersei insisted that she die because Cersei is a giant cunt. I hope Arya kills her, and I hope she does it slowly.",SPOILER
"While watching the first few episodes of season 6, I realized the timeline of which the high sparrow imprisoned people. Margaery and Loras were both captive longer than Cersei and kept their sanity better. Is it because Cersei legitimately couldn't handle being away from her kids/power? Or did she just give in the easy way to get back? If the second, then why didn't Margaery or Loras do the same if all they would have to do is the walk of atonement? ",SPOILER
"This was probably already posted here at some time but here goes. A lot of people have subscribed to the theory that Bran put the thought ""Burn them all"" in the Mad King's head but what if it was Bran as The Night King who put that thought in his head so that the initial events of killing Brandon and Rickard Stark would serve as the catalyst for Robert's Rebellion, the downfall of House Targaryen, the surge in power for House Lannister and so forth until The Night King gets a dragon to burn down the wall and invade Westeros for a yet undetermined endgame?",SPOILER
"im up to date on the show, currently awaiting S8, and i have a question that maybe u guys can clear up for me. why did ramsay do everything that he did to theon when house bolton and house greyjoy ended up on the same side anyways? theon betrayed house stark and so did house bolton not too long after, so why did ramsay torture theon the way that he did if their houses eventually had similar interests?",SPOILER
"Lots of theories floating around about Azor Ahai, the night king, 13th lord commander of the nights watch, Nissa Nissa, etc.

My prediction is that we get an ENTIRE episode, or close to it,that goes back in time and explains and shows this whole history.  Maybe as a Bran flashback.

It would be the only way to give it enough weight and explanation, to tie it into the current events and brining everything full circle.",SPOILER

"Two more questions struck me.

1. Could Robert Baratheon have killed Elia Martell and children in a rage of retribution. With Tywin covering it up for the good of the realm (peace / stability) and using the Mountain as a cover, unless Robert was at the Trident still.
2. Did Tyrion ever speak / meet with Edward Stark at all, not sure in books or tv show, would have been great.
3. Also as a side-note how do you think Tywin would have reacted to the undead presentation if he sat there instead of Cersei and what would his solution have been?",SPOILER

"One of the most controversial scenes of Season 7 shows Grey Worm and Missandei in a sex scene which is initiated by Grey Worm when he says that Missandei is his weakness. She gives him fear of losing Missandei of Naath.

In Season 2, when Tyrion and Shay are in the tower of the hand, Tyrion tells her that they are in a dangerous place and that She is his weakness. Which Shay takes completely the wrong way. Tyrion tries to calm the situation by saying that the language is tricky.",SPOILER

"Varys was on Dragonstone, and Jorah arrived there too after Samwell cured his Greyscale. Jorah was once a spy of Varys, arguably committing a crime against Daenerys by virtue of working for him?

Why didn't those characters meet on Dragonstone? It would have been a nice callback to season 1, and would have been an opportunity for some great dialogue, along the lines of Jorah saying ""My Queen, don't trust the Spider!""... It would be even more impactful if Varys turned on her in season 8. 

If Varys turns on Daenerys (I don't think he will, but still), Jorah should be the one to finish him off, too.",SPOILER
"We have a few months left before the new season and now is a good a time as any to start. If you had one scene from game of thrones to show someone to get them to watch the series, what would it be?

How badass would be if the night king won right? I think it'd be metal as fuck. But what if he wins gets to the iron throne sits down and just shatters. Because the throne was made with Dragonfire so it probably has a magic to it. Making it impossible for the Knight king to take the mantel of king of westeros. Granted idk if he even wants the throne or just to kill everyone who know. But I think it'd be hard ass.,SPOILER
"I was thinking about rewatching the whole series, but since it would be very time consuming, I decided to rewatch just some scenes - it made me rewatch the whole Battle of the Bastards (episode) and I newly noticed that during the last confrontation of the bastards, Littlefinger was present.

"FYI I haven't fully read the books yet so this is more in reference to the show.

What is it? Where did it come from? Why does it only transmit thru direct contact of the skin? Why does it make you savage and why send them to the destroyed city of Valyria?

Did the NK create it after failing to destroy Valyria and what it held(valyian steel, dragons)? I might have my timelines mixed up but if I'm right then last time the long night came was roughly the same time that (supposedly) the greatest city in history fell. What's your thoughts? Will this disease have any significance to the main story? Will it be addressed in the Age of Heroes spin off?

Edit: A couple have commented in regards to me being off with the destruction of valyria. I'd like to point out I'm more interested in the show and greyscale atm since I haven't read all the books yet. Also since it is in the books doesn't mean the show will follow the same line. Even the director of the show has stated that the show is different from the books so basing the show of the books isn't accurate. Valyria was destroyed by a volcano as someone pointed out in the books but there is no proof of what destroyed it in the show. It more or less looks like the city just collapsed rather than being melted and buried under ash and lava. Ex. Look at Pompeii, whole city buried by the ash and lava. Wouldn't the same thing happen to valyria to some extent rather than the city just looking post apocalypse? ",SPOILER
"What if The Seven (Gods) are the ones who are deep in the crypts of Winterfell? What if The Maiden is the Night's Queen? The current NK knows they're down there. They say dragons bring back magic. Maybe NK knows he needs a dragon at Winterfell to wake up the previous kings in the crypts. They say iron rusts so the iron swords guarding the statues/sarcophagi are gone. All that's needed to awaken the dead is magic. They always say magic disappeared when dragons died out, so perhaps dragons bring back the magic. Maybe the NK NEEDS the dragons to be at Winterfell and he knows they (dragons) will be there bc he saw Jon and Dany riding one- which is why he let them go. He didn't take the dragon she was riding bc he knew they would go back to WF and dragon magic is needed to wake The Seven.

Also wanted to add: MAYBE the NK \*has\* to go to WF bc there are no Starks at WF. It's part of the pact. He (NK) is a Stark- so he's keeping the pact himself now. Sansa is a LANNISTER/BOLTON, Arya is a FACELESS MAN, Jon is a TARG, and Bran is the 3-eyed Raven. There are technically no Starks at WF at the moment. Not too confident about this last part since NK has been on the move since first episode- but I feel like the fact there are no Starks at WF has a lot to do, or will have a lot to do with what's currently happening. Perhaps NK can also tap into the Weirwood net and he knew the pact was broken the minute there were no Starks at Winterfell.

"When ""Arya"" says ""I am Arya Stark of Winterfell"" it could be the waif just talking as a character, with Arya's face. It would make sense why Arya is so skilled in swordsmanship all of a sudden. And why the priest at the temple just lets her go, as if she just got the whole training for free..

"I hope I'm wrong but the teaser trailer which is located in the crypt of Winterfell gave me the chill, not because the Night King was coming, but the shadow of a lame end game scenario seemed to be looming over arguably the best thing on TV. 

So far, we are non the wiser about the Night Kings motives or end game.

However, from the books we learn that the crypt of Winterfell is a vast labyrinth, of tombs dating back to the the end of the long night. We also learn that the corpses, by ancient custom, are buried with heavy iron longswords accords their laps to '""keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts""ù
Also in the TV series, there has also been a stark absence of a character from the books.. the Night Queen.

The others were much more powerful then man and could easily replenish its Army.

For large scale battle scene, I'm going with the battle at Castle Black and the wall because there was so much variety to it.  There were giants and woolly mammoths working to open the gate on the wall, wildlings climbing up the ice wall, Tormund, Ygritte and the Therns doing battle inside of Castle Black, etc.  For my runner-up on large battle scene, it's close between Jon and the wildlings fighting the Night King, WW's, wights or Jon and the wildlings vs. Ramsay Bolton.  I'll probably give the edge to Jon and the wildlings vs. Ramsay Bolton because there was more strategy involved (or less strategy in Jon's case) and Sansa coming to Jon's rescue was interesting.

"There's something I've noticed about her character in Season 7 upon rewatching it. At the beginning she's got a huge ego, sense of entitlement, and a quick temper. We see this pretty much all throughout some previous seasons and most of Season 7. However once she sees the Army of the Dead and Viserion is killed, her world gets turned upside down. In the span of a few minutes not only does she see that the boogeyman is real, he also just killed one of her invincible dragons, and what she feels is one of her children for that matter. This is all capped off later that day when during her silent grieving, not only does she see the man she's growing in love with return alive, she also finally realizes that Davos was being literal when he said Jon died for his people. Despite seeing the absolute worst of men all the time during her journey, she finally sees one who rose to power because he truly loves his people, and inspires them to be the best they can. 

From that point forward, she doesn't show any of the personality traits I mentioned above. Seeing her almost cry by Jon's bedside, it was like seeing the old Dany again back in S1 and S2. When Jon pledged his loyalty to her, her response wasn't ""Thank you"" or ""About time"". It was ""I hope I deserve it."" From there and Episode 7, she comes off more humble than she used to be.

I hope they continue this new development of her character into Season 8. I love Jon Snow, but just like Dany he isn't perfect. But I believe these two compliment each other so well, because they both make up for each other's flaws. While Jon can inspire Daenerys to reign her temper and ego in, and be more compassionate, Dany can make the tough decisions that Jon can't bring himself to. Not to mention get him out of trouble that his honor gets himself into.

The part when Arya and Jaqen talk he appears to be giving the poison to Arya but drinks it and dies. The Waif removes her face to reveal Jaqen's face.

Arya then proceeds to remove the face of Jaqen from the dead body, then reveals her own face.

So I've read the books also, my questions are: Can the faceless assassins wear the face of a living person without killing them, some form of glamor maybe?

Multiple copies of the same face, Waif Jaqen and the Jaqen face on the dead body?

I get the impression that Jaqen has been dead already and the faceless assassins wear that face throughout so we as a audience have a reference.

But is the Waif already dead like Jaqen and the face is just being used by different faceless people?

Also when Arya killed the Waif and took the face to hang on the wall, was that the the original face of the assassin, or if a faceless person wore the Waif face, would they go after Arya again?",SPOILER

When Jon Connington arrived at the Stoney Sept, he supposedly couldn't find Robert anywhere. It later turns out that Robert(on a quest for his loved one?) was hiding in a brothel....

Just like Renly, there was more than meets the eyeWe know that Barristan Selmy was badly hurt at the Battle of the Trident but he was pardoned by Robert, and held in **high praise** by both him and **Ned Stark**. For fighting against them?

> Rhaegar met Lord Robert Baratheon in combat at a ford during the battle of the Trident, where the pair had a legendary duel in the raging rivers of the Trident. Rhaegar, despite wounding Robert, was struck down([or was he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edp6WbXSZEQ)?) with a massive blow from Robert's warhammer, which scattered the **rubies** encrusted in Rhaegar's armor into the water...The location was named the **ruby ford** thereafter. Rhaegar died with **Lyanna** Stark's name **on his lips**. 

According to a semi-canon source, Rhaegar's body was **cremated**, as is traditional for fallen Targaryens...Only **death** can pay for **life**.  But then how do we actually know it was Rhaegar who died there?

We hear of another defeat, at the hand of [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) himself, where he defeated Robert at the Battle of Ashford. 

Although, it was largely won by Randyll Tarly by the time he got there. Still, Mace Tyrell "" is considered an oaf by his mother, and by Cersei Lannister, and a **fool** by Prince Oberyn Martell. Out of his three sons, he considers Loras to be his favourite.But he really didn't care for Willas, whom he sent to fight in a tourney at 10 to fight the Viper, unless the boy saw something he should not have...


>  [[Willas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI)](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willas_Tyrell\)) was born the eldest son to Lord **Mace Tyrell**(*the fool?*) and Lady Alerie **Hightower**. During his **first tourney**, he competed **against Prince Oberyn Martell** of Dorne, who **knocked Willas** from his horse. Unfortunately, his foot caught in his stirrup as he fell, and [Willas pulled his horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcnFPp2mFoc) on top of him, [crushing his leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgsbTSVLD4) and leaving him **a cripple**.



Robert was not a great warrior. He couldn't have defeated Jon Connington before and he wouldn't have been able to defeat Rhaegar on the battlefield. Just like Mace Tyrell, and like his brother later on,  **Robert Baratheon**, had a warrior to fight in his stead. 

The rubies in the ford that were scattered in the river were not from Rhaegar's breastplate.. They were from Jon's.

> Robert is a man of huge appetites, who knows how to take his pleasures. He is quite promiscuous, and has fathered multiple bastard children. His lusts are the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realms.


Robert, after winning the Throne, accepts red priests(who turn him more into even more a drunkard rather than save him) at his court. Why he chooses to marry Cersei Lannister.. and to pardon Barristan Selmy, who after killing Jon Connington, would have done the same to Robert.

> During his elder years, Corlys Velaryon liked to say that he was clinging to life ""like a drowning sailor clinging to the wreckage of a sunken ship."" 

Robert's [last words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K517YIJKcfw): ""at least they'll say I did this right.. this **ONE** thing.(So he never won a battle)"" ..

According to Archmaester Gyldayn, Alyn's origins remain a matter of dispute among historians to this day. **His mother**, Marilda of Hull, **claimed** he and his brother Addam were **fathered by Ser Laenor Velaryon** -- a fact that many found remarkable due to** Laenor's known sexual preference for men.** The court **fool** Mushroom **claimed** they were fathered by Laenor's father, Lord **Corlys Velaryon**,but **kept unacknowledged** and far from court in order to not offend Corlys's fiery-tempered wife, Rhaenys Targaryen.

Two brothers had been born as Lords of the Tides and heirs to Driftmark. One of them, Addam, would manage to win Lord Velaryon's old dragon, Seasmoke. His brother, who initially went after the wildest dragon, **Grey Ghost**, would almost get killed by Sheepstealer. Alyn was then said to have had two bastards children by **Elaena Targaryen**. He would name them **Jon** and **Jeyne Waters**.... A distant relative of Elaena, Brown Ben Plumm, the commander of the Second Sons, would end up miraculosly fighting for Daenerys..

"Laws and Customs of the peoples living in the Seven Kingdoms are based on their feudal system of government.
",NON-SPOILER
"Lords have judicial power over cases that occur on their lands. A lord will hear petitions at his local castle-court, sit in judgment at trials, and pass sentence based on the evidence. In theory, justice derives from the authority of the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, who sits on the Iron Throne in the capital city of King's Landing. The King's power is delegated out to other great lords of the realm. This extends in a hierarchy from the king, to the rulers of the Great Houses (such as House Lannister), to major Houses (such as House Tarth), to minor Houses (such as House Cassel).[1]
",NON-SPOILER
"The King's Peace is supposed to extend over the whole realm, and though small scale feuds or succession wars happen now and again, the constant wars between the independent Seven Kingdoms were put to an end when they were unified in the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago. The King's peace also extends to protection from outlaws and pirates. The Targaryen Conquest specifically forced the ironborn to abandon their Old Way of preying on the commercial shipping of Westeros itself (though it is tacitly acknowledged that they instead raid the shipping and shores of other lands in Essos for plunder).
",NON-SPOILER
"The Seven Kingdoms do have a ìMaster of Lawsî, suggesting some sort of statutory written laws exist, but their legal system still appears to be primarily based on customary laws, prior precedent, and the wisdom of the lord presiding over a decision.
",NON-SPOILER
"Individual lords are supposed to enforce the laws and carry out punishment on their own lands. Only the major cities (and possibly a few of the large towns) have dedicated ìpolice forcesî, such as the City Watch of King's Landing.
",NON-SPOILER
"Gaining the title of knighthood does not make a man a lord, though many knights do eventually become lords. Knighthood is a middle-step between noble-born lords and commoners. A commoner can be knighted for valorous service in battle, but the title is not hereditary. A commoner who is knighted usually starts out as a ìhedge knightî, a poor freelance knight not bound in allegiance to a specific lord (considered to be so poor that they sleep under hedges by the roadside while searching for employment). The next step up for a prospective knight is to become a ìsworn swordî, sworn to the service of a particular lord. Beyond this step, a sworn sword may become a ìlanded knightî if his lord rewards him with land for his service, typically a smallholding, large farm or small manor with servants. Successful landed knights who expand their holdings or continue to perform exemplary service for their liege may be raised to the rank of ""Lord"" in time, leading a minor noble House. Sometimes a knight may skip some of these steps, and while rare it is not unheard of for a lord to reward a commoner for valorous service by granting him both land and the title of knighthood, as when Stannis Baratheon rewarded Davos Seaworth for his rescue of the garrison during the Siege of Storm's End.
",NON-SPOILER
"The difference between a ìlanded knightî and a ìminor lordî is often very subtle, as some landed knights may actually be wealthier and more powerful than minor lords whose families have fallen on hard times. However, the vital distinction is that only a ìlordî legally possesses the power of justice, which a landed knight does not. For example, House Clegane is a House of landed knights in service of House Lannister, but it is not a lordly House. Thus the head of the House, Gregor Clegane, does not possess the legal right to hear trials and pass judgement.
",NON-SPOILER
"The society and legal system of the Seven Kingdoms recognizes a hereditary noble class set above a class of commoners, who are officially known as ""smallfolk"" (the very name indicates their lower social standing). Members of the nobility are also known as ""highborn"", while commoners are known as ""lowborn"". Nobles officially possess more legal rights than the commoners do. Many crimes for which a lowborn peasant would be punished by having their hand cut off a noble will only be punished for by paying a fine. The noble-born also have the right to demand a trial by combat.
",NON-SPOILER
"There are a number of wealthy merchants in the few cities and towns, but on the whole, the Seven Kingdomsí society is feudal and agricultural. While there is a small merchant class, it does not extend far beyond the five major cities (Kingís Landing, Oldtown, Lannisport, Gulltown, and White Harbor). Even a wealthy merchant in Kingís Landing is still legally considered to be a ìcommonerî.
",NON-SPOILER
"Women, even noble-born women, do not have the same legal standing as men. Inheritance only falls on a woman if there are no males in her family ahead of her in line of succession. However, women can rule in their own right if they have no surviving brothers (and their brothers left no surviving heirs). An exception is Dorne, which allows equal inheritance. If the noble-born heir to a lordship is underaged (or otherwise infirm and unfit to carry out their duties), a regent may be appointed to rule in their name.
",NON-SPOILER
"Members of religious organizations are a different section of society, technically not nobles but possessing special privileges that commoners do not possess. This of course primarily applies to the clergy of the Faith of the Seven, the dominant religion in the Seven Kingdoms. The religion of the Old Gods of the Forest, which is the dominant religion in the North, has no organized clergy at all. In the Iron Islands, the Drowned Men who serve as the priests for their local religion devoted to the Drowned God are also held in high social esteem. In past centuries, the Faith of the Seven had the power to conduct its own trials in ecclesiastical courts. However, they lost the right to hold trials after the Targaryen Conquest, when such public powers were brought under the exclusive control of the king on the Iron Throne.
",NON-SPOILER
"Bastard children of a noble, who have been acknowledged by their noble parent, are allowed to take a special bastard surname which signifies their status and that they are of noble blood.[2] These bastard surnames are based on the region a child was born in, thus bastards from the North use the special surname ìSnowî (e.g. Jon Snow, Ramsay Snow), bastards from the Riverlands use the special surname ìRiversî, etc. Bastards are not allowed to inherit their parents'†lands and have no place in the line of succession (unless they are legitimized by special order of the king and allowed take their parents'†surname, which rarely happens). Even so, the acknowledged bastard children of a noble are still technically ìhighbornî, and enjoy legal rights which commoners do not possess. Unacknowledged bastards, of course, cannot confirm that they are indeed the bastard child of a noble, and thus are legally considered commoners (such as Gendry, who is secretly the unacknowledged bastard son of King Robert Baratheon). There is no outright law punishing noble men or women for having bastard children, instead it is considered a social and religious disgrace. This disgrace for having bastard children or being a bastard is not so great, however, in Dorne.
",NON-SPOILER
"The legal age of majority in the Seven Kingdoms is considered to be sixteen years of age (this may have been changed to eighteen years in the TV series). Their society does not possess a concept of ìadolescenceî as an intervening life-stage between childhood and adulthood. As soon as a boy reaches his sixteenth nameday, he suddenly becomes ìa man grownî, and is legally considered to be an adult. Legally, girls are also considered adults at sixteen, though culturally they are often seen as suddenly becoming ìa womanî as soon as they have menstruated. A girl who has had her first blood is often seen as now capable of being married.
",NON-SPOILER
"Inheritance practices usually follow primogeniture, a male-preference winner-take-all system.
",NON-SPOILER
"The local laws in Dorne are somewhat different from the rest of the realm, as it joined the realm not through conquest but through peaceful marriage-alliance only a century ago, and was thus allowed to retain several local customs. In particular, Dorne practices equal primogeniture, in which the eldest child inherits regardless of whether they are male or female.
",NON-SPOILER
"Marriage customs in the Seven Kingdoms vary considerably between the three major religions, and there are local variations in custom between different lands within the same regions.
",NON-SPOILER
"The best documented are the marriage customs of the Faith of the Seven, as it is the dominant religion on the continent. While the scale of the marriage can vary, it at least involves the couple exchanging marriage vows in a ceremony performed by a Septon, acting as a sacred witness. Large-scale marriages are typically performed in septs, before the gathered families of the bride and groom.
",NON-SPOILER
"Children born outside of marriage are bastards and cannot inherit lands or wealth from their parents. The Seven Kingdoms do have a system for acknowledging bastards with special region-based surnames (such as ""Snow"", ""Sand"", etc.), but they still cannot inherit.
",NON-SPOILER
"Marriages among the nobility of the Seven Kingdoms are rarely made for love, but as a means of securing political alliances between noble families. Arranged marriages to secure marriage alliances are very common. It is considered absurd for a member of the more powerful noble families to marry a commoner, throwing away any chance and a valuable marriage pact. Marriages into the royal family are seen as particularly valuable.
",NON-SPOILER
"It is considered unseemly for a girl to marry before she has ""flowered"", but a girl as young as thirteen or so is considered a ""woman"" after she has first had her blood, and thus capable of being married and having children. It is frowned upon for a girl to marry if she has not bled yet, but betrothals can still be established for young girls to be married when they are older.
",NON-SPOILER
"A marriage is only legally considered to be binding if it has been consummated, that is, if the bride and groom have had sex at least once. If a marriage has not been consummated, it may be annulled.
",NON-SPOILER
"The nobility in the Seven Kingdoms practice a custom known as a ""Bedding"", in which after the wedding feast is over, the bride and groom are physically carried off to the marriage bed, to ensure that the union is consummated. The men at the wedding carry off the bride, and the women carry off the groom. The group carrying each strips the clothing off the newlyweds while telling ribald jokes. Foreigners think this is a somewhat odd custom.
",NON-SPOILER
"Social customs are somewhat different in Dorne, which has more liberal attitudes towards sexuality. A holdover from the old court culture of their Rhoynar ancestorsí city-states on the eastern continent is that Dornish society still allows nobles to keep ""paramours"" - formal mistresses/unmarried lovers who can be male or female. Outsiders from the other kingdoms often dismissively think of Dornish paramours as little more than mistresses or prostitutes, but they often have significant social standing in Dorne. Some are even functionally treated as wives in all but name, such as Oberyn Martell's paramour Ellaria Sand.
",NON-SPOILER
"As a feudal society, the Seven Kingdoms do not maintain long-standing dedicated prisons. There are dungeons in the major cities and castles, but these are not meant for long-term confinement of a prison population: they are more along the lines of holding pens used until sentencing through corporal or capital punishment. Valuable military or political prisoners may be confined for an extended period, i.e. in the Black Cells under the Red Keep, but this is exceptional.
",NON-SPOILER
"Certain serious offenses such as rape are punishable by amputation (specifically castration), though in some cases even petty theft may be punishable by amputating a hand. Treason and oathbreaking are punishable by death. Those sentenced to execution or amputation, noble or commoner, have the option of joining the Night's Watch instead, as a form of exile (this has caused some to look down on the present-day Nightís Watch as a glorified penal colony). Only men can join the Nightís Watch, so women do not have this option (they usually join the monastic order of Silent Sisters instead). Once a man has sworn the oath to join the Nightís Watch, the oath is for life, and the penalty for desertion is death. Open refusal of a direct order is also considered treason and oathbreaking to the Night's Watch, and punishable by death. However, in certain situations, such as the ruling monarch's approval, it is possible for someone to actually leave the Night's Watch.

"In the south, professional executioners deal out death sentences, often by beheading or hanging. The royal executioner is known as the ìKing's Justiceî, though in a looser sense the term ""kingís justice"" refers to the laws enforced by the kingís authority throughout the realm (i.e. the executioner who acts as ìKingís Justiceî thus becomes the living embodiment of law and sentence).
",NON-SPOILER
"The North, however, still follows the practices of the First Men, which holds that the man who pronounces the sentence must swing the sword. The reasoning is that if a lord is not steadfast enough in his convictions to look a man he has sentenced in the eye and then kill him personally, there will be doubt that the condemned man was guilty. Moreover, the life-or-death struggle for survival that the Northmen have had to face in winters means that they take the weight of command very seriously. The Northmen feel that if a lord cannot look a condemned man in the face as he personally executes him, he is unworthy of the weight of responsibility and consequences of his own orders. Furthermore, the punishment is not only limited to beheading with a sword; for instance, following the Battle of the Bastards, Ramsay Bolton is executed for his crimes against House Stark, but Sansa Stark, as Ned Stark's eldest living trueborn child, does not personally behead him, but sets Ramsay's own hounds on him to devour him alive as she watches. Had Jon Snow, who is older than Sansa, also been trueborn, it would logically have fallen down to Jon to behead Ramsay personally (although Jon was later revealed to be Ned's nephew).
",NON-SPOILER
"In the Iron Islands, condemned prisoners are often put to death by drowning.
",NON-SPOILER
"House Bolton in past centuries infamously practiced flaying, both as punishment against criminals and as a method of torture against enemies. After House Bolton was defeated by House Stark a thousand years ago, and absorbed under their rule of the Kingdom in the North, the Kings of House Stark outlawed this practice. After the Targaryen Conquest, when the Boltons were still vassals under the rule of House Stark, flaying remained illegal.

"Blood money is sometimes turned to as an alternative punishment for murder, to end a feud. In this case, the family or lord of a murderer will pay a large fine to the family of the man he killed, thus resolving the matter.

"People do pay some taxes to the central government in Kingís Landing, but it isn't enough to sustain a standing royal army. Typically, under a manorial system, peasants pay their rent to the local lord as taxes-in-kind from the crops they raise or metals they mine. The Great Houses also collect taxes from their vassal Houses.
",NON-SPOILER
"The crown also imposes various tariffs and fines on trade and shipping. Smugglers do try to sneak cargo past customs officials to avoid high shipping fees at ports, though the penalty if caught for smuggling is amputation. Davos Seaworth was once a notorious smuggler, yet was rewarded by Stannis Baratheon for his aid during the Siege of Stormís End. Stannis rewarded Davos with land and title, but still insisted on punishing him for his past smuggling crimes. However, while the penalty is often the amputation of an entire hand, Stannis commuted the sentence to simply cutting off Davosí fingertips on his non-dominant hand.
",NON-SPOILER
"Prostitution is tacitly legal in the Seven Kingdoms, in the sense that there is no official law preventing brothels from openly operating in the major cities and towns. Organized religion does discourage prostitution, and it is socially frowned upon, but it is nonetheless present, sometimes seen as an outlet for uncontrollable male sexual desires. Secular lords and kings have not (in general) tried to shut down prostitution, as taxing brothels is a good source of revenue.

In 300 AC, King Joffrey I Baratheon tells Margaery Tyrell that King Renly I Baratheon was a ""known degenerate"" and he had considered making his ""perversion"" punishable by death. In 301 AC, at the wedding feast of King Joffrey I Baratheon and Queen Margaery Tyrell, during the re-enactment of the War of the Five Kings by dwarves, Loras leaves his seat on the dais and doesn't return after witnessing one of the dwarves dressed as Renly ridding a naked Loras, symbolizing Renly and Loras having anal sex.

Later, a group of Sparrows ransack Littlefinger's brothel. Olyvar is struck and ignored as they barge in. Olyvar hears screams coming from another room which he approaches to see the Sparrows have singled out a male client having sex with one of the male prostitutes. The Sparrows had assaulted the customer and prostitute with knives and hurled homophobic slurs against them. One Sparrow approaches one of the men with a knife.

At the holy inquest for Loras, he denies the charges of ""fornication, buggery and blasphemyî against him. Later, Loras' lover, Olyvar, testifies that he and Loras have both engaged in sexual intercourse together. Loras is again detained until being put on trail in 303 AC for the charges against him.

"Slavery has been illegal in the Seven Kingdoms for thousands of years. Slavery is considered an abomination by both the Faith of the Seven and the worshippers of the Old Gods of the Forest. It was illegal in Westeros long before there even were Seven Kingdoms, and the unification of the Seven Kingdoms in the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago only served to strengthen the enforcement of this prohibition. Even selling criminals to foreign slavers from Essos is considered a heinous crime. When Jorah Mormont sold some poachers he caught on his lands to foreign slavers, he forfeited his lands and fled into exile.

"One of the major differences between the society of the Seven Kingdoms and the lands north of the Wall is that the Free Folk do not recognize a class of hereditary nobility within their culture. Instead, they choose their own leaders based on their ability, such as when a King-Beyond-the-Wall manages to unite the many wildling clans. From their perspective, the Free Folk see the ìkneelersî who live in the Seven Kingdoms as functionally slaves, serving under masters who only rule them because their fathers did.

"Essos, the eastern continent across the Narrow Sea from Westeros, is vast and culturally very diverse. It would be difficult to discuss the ""Laws and Customs"" of the entire continent in one place (anymore than the Laws and Customs of ""Eurasia"" could be succinctly lumped together). Also, the narrative describes their societies in much less detail, so less is known about each of their distinct customs. Therefore, see the main articles on the Free Cities, Dothraki, Qarth, and Slaver's Bay for further information on the Laws and Customs of each region.
",NON-SPOILER
"In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, it is stated that many centuries ago, certain areas of the Seven Kingdoms had lords who practiced the right of ìFirst Nightî, to sleep with a commonerís wife on their wedding night. The practice was outlawed in many regions long ago, and was officially outlawed throughout the Seven Kingdoms two hundred years ago by King Jaehaerys I, grandson of Aegon the Conqueror. Nothing remotely like First Night ever existed in the real-life Middle Ages. It is an urban legend. The film Braveheart in particular popularized the belief that it was ever a real phenomenon, which was very controversial because historians had already rejected First Night as nothing but a myth fifty years before Braveheart was even made. Nonetheless, this became a major plot point in the books: Roose Bolton was known to claim the right of First Night even though it had been illegal for centuries; the product of one such rape was his bastard son and major character, Ramsay Snow.†
",NON-SPOILER
"In the real-life Middle Ages, prostitution was also usually not technically illegal. The rationalization that was usually given in such male-dominated societies was that it was a convenient outlet for male sexual desires, which were assuredly uncontrollable ñ the concept that men should simply try to restrain such impulses and their own behavior wasnít frequently considered. A general attitude of ""boys will be boys"" pervaded.
",NON-SPOILER
"At different times, real-life medieval countries had actual laws punishing homosexual acts and behavior. No specific mention has been made of anything like this in the books. Renly Baratheon and Loras Tyrell do hide their sexual relationship, though this could just be due to the religious condemnation they would face from the Faith of the Seven, not an actual secular law they would face punishment from. Dorne is quite tolerant and widely accepting of homosexuality and thus seems to have no outright ""laws"" punishing it, though Dorne was allowed to retain many of its own local laws when it entered the realm through a marriage alliance, such as equal primogeniture. Thus, the ""legal status"" of homosexuality in Dorne is not indicative of its legal status in the other kingdoms.
",NON-SPOILER
"Among the wildlings, who do not have established laws but loose customs, a man and woman are considered to be ""married"" if a man successfully ""steals"" a woman away while risking severe injury or even death by the woman and her relatives. The woman is expected to fight back the whole way. As a rule, the wildlings do not kidnap married women. If the man is able to successfully defend himself from her assault, it shows that he is strong, brave and cunning, and this is what wildling women seek in men. If the man turns out to be an abusive husband, the wife can always slit his throat. Because Jon took Ygritte prisoner instead of killing her and later spares her life, Ygritte and Tormund point out to Jon that he and Ygritte could be considered technically married. This stuns Jon, who reveals this was not his intent and his capture of her/saving her life was not for sex.  From a strictly technical standpoint, they are considered officially married in wildling culture.

It has been acclaimed by critics, particularly for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) have been criticized.  The series has received 47 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, and 2018, more than any other primetime scripted television series. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation (2012ñ2014), a 2011 Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series ñ Drama (2012 and 2015ñ2018).

"Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of A Song of Ice and Fire, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos. The series chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among the realm's noble families for the Iron Throne, while other families fight for independence from it. It opens with additional threats in the icy North and Essos in the east.

"Showrunner David Benioff jokingly suggested ""The Sopranos in Middle-earth"" as Game of Thrones' tagline, referring to its intrigue-filled plot and dark tone in a fantasy setting of magic and dragons. In a 2012 study of deaths per episode, it ranked second out of 40 recent U.S. TV drama series (with an average of 14).
",NON-SPOILER
"The series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has stated that ""the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.""
",NON-SPOILER
"A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Just like people's capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story. Benioff said, ""George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.""
",NON-SPOILER
"In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed ""plot armor"" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. The series also reflects the substantial death rates in war.
",NON-SPOILER
"Although the first season closely follows the events of the first novel, later seasons have made significant changes. According to David Benioff, the series is ""about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way"".
",NON-SPOILER
"The novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings, characters, and plot on events in European history. Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from lands and cultures, to the palace intrigue, feudal system, castles, and knightly tournaments. A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455ñ85) between the houses of Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin's houses of Lannister and Stark. The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the ""she-wolf of France"" (1295ñ1358); Isabella and her family (particularly as portrayed in Maurice Druon's historical-novel series, The Accursed Kings) were also a main inspiration for Martin.
",NON-SPOILER
"Holland further proposes that other historical antecedents of series elements include Hadrian's Wall (which becomes Martin's Wall), the Roman Empire, and the legend of Atlantis (ancient Valyria), Byzantine Greek fire (""wildfire""), Icelandic sagas of the Viking Age (the Ironborn), the Mongol hordes (the Dothraki), the Hundred Years' War, and the Italian Renaissance. The series' popularity has been attributed, in part, to Martin's skill at fusing these elements into a seamless, credible version of alternate history. Martin acknowledges, ""I take [history] and I file off the serial numbers and I turn it up to 11.""
",NON-SPOILER
"Game of Thrones has an ensemble cast estimated to be the largest on television; during its third season, 257 cast names were recorded. In 2014, several actor contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option, with raises which reportedly made them among the highest-paid performers on cable TV. In 2016, several actor contracts were again renegotiated, reportedly increasing the salary of five of the main cast members to £2 million per episode for the last two seasons, which would make them the highest paid actors on television. The main cast is listed below.

"Lord Eddard ""Ned"" Stark (Sean Bean) is the head of House Stark, whose members are involved in plot lines throughout most of the series. He and his wife, Catelyn Tully (Michelle Fairley), have five children: Robb (Richard Madden), the eldest, followed by Sansa (Sophie Turner), Arya (Maisie Williams), Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), and Rickon (Art Parkinson), the youngest. Ned's illegitimate son Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and his friend, Samwell Tarly (John Bradley), serve in the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont (James Cosmo). The Wildlings living north of the Wall include young Gilly (Hannah Murray), and warriors Tormund Giantsbane (Kristofer Hivju), and Ygritte (Rose Leslie).

"Others associated with House Stark include Ned's ward Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen), his vassal Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton), and Bolton's bastard son, Ramsay Snow (Iwan Rheon). Robb falls in love with the healer Talisa Maegyr (Oona Chaplin), and Arya befriends the blacksmith's apprentice Gendry (Joe Dempsie) and the assassin Jaqen H'ghar (Tom Wlaschiha). The tall warrior Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) serves Catelyn and, later, Sansa.

"In King's Landing, the capital, Ned's friend, King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy), shares a loveless marriage with Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), who has taken her twin brother, the ""Kingslayer"" Ser Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), as her lover. She loathes her younger brother, the dwarf Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), who is attended by his mistress Shae (Sibel Kekilli) and the sellsword Bronn (Jerome Flynn). Cersei's father is Lord Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance). Cersei also has two young sons: Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman). Joffrey is guarded by the scar-faced warrior, Sandor ""the Hound"" Clegane (Rory McCann).

"In January 2006, David Benioff had a phone conversation with George R. R. Martin's literary agent about the books he represented and became interested in A Song of Ice and Fire, as he had been a fan of fantasy fiction when young but had not read the books before.  The literary agent then sent Benioff the series' first four books. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel, A Game of Thrones, shared his enthusiasm with D. B. Weiss, and suggested that they adapt Martin's novels into a television series; Weiss finished the first novel in ""maybe 36 hours"". They pitched the series to HBO after a five-hour meeting with Martin (himself a veteran screenwriter) in a restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard. According to Benioff, they won Martin over with their answer to his question, ""Who is Jon Snow's mother?""

"Before being approached by Benioff and Weiss, Martin had had other meetings with other scriptwriters, most of whom wanted to adapt the series as a feature film. Martin, however, deemed it ""unfilmable"" and impossible to be done as a feature film, stating that the size of one of his novels is as long as The Lord of the Rings, which had been adapted as three feature films. Similarly, Benioff also said that it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as the scale of the novels is too big for a feature film, and dozens of characters would have to be discarded. Benioff added, ""a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That means no sex, no blood, no profanity. Fuck that."" Martin himself was pleased with the suggestion that they adapt it as an HBO series, saying that he ""never imagined it anywhere else"". ""I knew it couldn't be done as a network television series. It's too adult. The level of sex and violence would never have gone through.""
",NON-SPOILER
"The series began development in January 2007. HBO acquired the TV rights to the novels, with Benioff and Weiss as its executive producers, and Martin as a co-executive producer. The intention was for each novel to yield a season's worth of episodes. Initially, Martin would write one episode per season while Benioff and Weiss would write the rest of the episodes. Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were later added to write one episode apiece the first season.
",NON-SPOILER
"The first and second drafts of the pilot script by Benioff and Weiss were submitted in August 2007 and June 2008, respectively. Although HBO liked both drafts, a pilot was not ordered until November 2008; the 2007ñ2008 Writers Guild of America strike may have delayed the process. The pilot episode, ""Winter Is Coming"", was first shot in 2009; after a poor reception in a private viewing, HBO demanded an extensive re-shoot (about 90 percent of the episode, with cast and directorial changes).
",NON-SPOILER
"The pilot reportedly cost HBO $5ñ10 million to produce, while the first season's budget was estimated at $50ñ60 million. In the second season, the series received a 15-percent budget increase for the climactic battle in ""Blackwater"" (which had an $8 million budget). Between 2012 and 2015, the average budget per episode increased from $6 million to ""at least"" $8 million. The sixth-season budget was over $10 million per episode, for a season total of over $100 million and a series record.

"Nina Gold and Robert Sterne are the series' primary casting directors. Through a process of auditions and readings, the main cast was assembled. The only exceptions were Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, whom the writers wanted from the start; they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009. Other actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen, and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon. Addy was, according to showrunners Benioff and Weiss, the easiest actor to cast for the series, being that his audition was on point. Some of the characters in the pilot were recast for the first season: Catelyn Stark was initially played by Jennifer Ehle, but the role was recast with Michelle Fairley. Daenerys Targaryen was also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant. The rest of the first season's cast was filled in the second half of 2009.
",NON-SPOILER
"Although many of the cast returned after the first season, the producers had many new characters to cast for each of the following seasons. Due to the large number of new characters, Benioff and Weiss postponed the introduction of several key characters in the second season and merged several characters into one or assigned plot functions to different characters. Some recurring characters were recast over the years; for example, Gregor Clegane was played by three different actors, while Dean-Charles Chapman who played Tommen Baratheon also played a minor Lannister character.

"Game of Thrones used seven writers in six seasons. Series creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the showrunners, write most of the episodes each season.
",NON-SPOILER
"A Song of Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin wrote one episode in each of the first four seasons. Martin did not write an episode for the later seasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel (The Winds of Winter). Jane Espenson co-wrote one first-season episode as a freelance writer.
",NON-SPOILER
"Bryan Cogman, initially a script coordinator for the series, was promoted to producer for the fifth season. Cogman, who wrote at least one episode for the first five seasons, is the only other writer in the writers' room with Benioff and Weiss. Before his promotion, Vanessa Taylor (a writer during the second and third seasons) worked closely with Benioff and Weiss. Dave Hill joined the writing staff for the fifth season after working as an assistant to Benioff and Weiss. Although Martin is not in the writers' room, he reads the script outlines and makes comments.
",NON-SPOILER
"Benioff and Weiss sometimes assign characters to particular writers; for example, Cogman was assigned to Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another two to three weeks discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took a month and a half to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.

"Benioff and Weiss originally intended to adapt the entire, still-incomplete A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels for television.[citation needed] After Game of Thrones began outpacing the published novels in the sixth season, the series was based on a plot outline of the future novels provided by Martin and original content. In April 2016, the showrunners' plan was to shoot 13 more episodes after the sixth season: seven episodes in the seventh season and six episodes in the eighth. Later that month, the series was renewed for a seventh season with a seven-episode order. Eight seasons were ordered and filmed, adapting the novels at a rate of about 48 seconds per page for the first three seasons.
",NON-SPOILER
"The first two seasons adapted one novel each. For the later seasons, its creators see Game of Thrones as an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire as a whole rather than the individual novels; this enables them to move events across novels, according to screen-adaptation requirements.

"Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010, and the primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak), Castle Ward (Winterfell), Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood), Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes), Cairncastle (the execution site), the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black), and Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds). Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell. The producers initially considered filming the whole series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because of the availability of studio space.

"The first season's southern scenes were filmed in Malta, a change in location from the  pilot episode's Moroccan sets. The city of Mdina was used for King's Landing. Filming was also done at Fort Manoel (representing the Sept of Baelor), at the Azure Window on the island of Gozo (the Dothraki wedding site) and at San Anton Palace, Fort Ricasoli, Fort St. Angelo and St. Dominic monastery (all used for scenes in the Red Keep).
",NON-SPOILER
"Filming of the second season's southern scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, where the city of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled, coastal medieval city. The Walls of Dubrovnik and Fort Lovrijenac were used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. The island of Lokrum, the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of Trogir, the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, and the Dubac quarry (a few kilometers east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of the Wall, in the Frostfangs and at the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland: on the Vatnajˆkull glacier near Smyrlabjˆrg, the SvÌnafellsjˆkull glacier near Skaftafell and the M˝rdalsjˆkull glacier near Vik on Hˆfabrekkuheii.

"Third-season production returned to Dubrovnik, with the Walls of Dubrovnik, Fort Lovrijenac and nearby locations again used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. Trsteno Arboretum, a new location, is the garden of the Tyrells in King's Landing. The third season also returned to Morocco (including the city of Essaouira) to film Daenerys' scenes in Essos. Dimmuborgir and the GrjÛtagj· cave in Iceland were used as well. One scene, with a live bear, was filmed in Los Angeles. The production used three units (Dragon, Wolf and Raven) filming in parallel, six directing teams, 257 cast members and 703 crew members.

Brian Kirk directed three episodes during the first season, and Tim Van Patten directed the series' first two episodes. Neil Marshall directed two episodes, both with large battle scenes: ""Blackwater"" and ""The Watchers on the Wall"".

"The costumes used in the series drew inspiration from a number of sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can recognize the main characters. Bjˆrk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.

"About two dozen wigs are used for the actresses. Made of human hair and up to 2 feet (61†cm) in length, they cost up to $7,000 each and are washed and styled like real hair. Applying the wigs is time-consuming; Emilia Clarke, for example, requires about two hours to style her brunette hair with a platinum-blonde wig and braids. Other actors, such as Jack Gleeson and Sophie Turner, receive frequent hair coloring. For characters such as Daenerys (Clarke) and her Dothraki, their hair, wigs and costumes are processed to appear as if they have not been washed for weeks.

"For the series' large number of visual effects, HBO hired British-based BlueBolt and Irish-based Screen Scene for season one.

The muscle and wing movements of the adolescent dragons in seasons four and five were based largely on those of a chicken. Pixomondo retained a team of 22 to 30 people which focused solely on visualizing Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, with the average production time per season of 20 to 22 weeks.

"The series' title sequence was created by production studio Elastic for HBO. Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world. The map is projected on the inside of a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere. As the camera moves across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map. Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear. The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writer(s) and director. Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all.

Soundtrack albums for subsequent seasons have been released, with tracks by the National, the Hold Steady, and Sigur RÛs. Djawadi has composed themes for each of the major houses and also for some of the main characters. The themes may evolve over time, as Daenerys Targaryen's theme started small and then became more powerful after each season. Her theme started first with a single instrument, a cello, and Djawadi later incorporated more instruments for it.

An unnamed episode was downloaded about 4,280,000 times through public BitTorrent trackers in 2012, roughly equal to its number of broadcast viewers. Piracy rates were particularly high in Australia, and U.S. Ambassador to Australia Jeff Bleich issued a statement condemning Australian piracy of the series in 2013.

"Delays in availability apart from HBO and its affiliates before 2015 and the cost of subscriptions to these services have been cited as causes of the series' illegal distribution. According to TorrentFreak, a subscription to a service for Game of Thrones would cost up to $25 per month in the United States, up to £26 per episode in the UK and up to $52 per episode in Australia.

"For ""combating piracy"", HBO said in 2013 that it intended to make its content more widely available within a week of the U.S. premiere (including HBO Go). In 2015, the fifth season was simulcast to 170 countries and to HBO Now users. On April 11, the day before the season premiere, screener copies of the first four episodes of the fifth season leaked to a number of file-sharing websites. Within a day of the leak, the files were downloaded over 800,000 times; in one week the illegal downloads reached 32†million, with the season-five premiere alone (""The Wars to Come"") pirated 13†million times. The season-five finale (""Mother's Mercy"") was the most simultaneously shared file in the history of the BitTorrent filesharing protocol, with over 250,000 simultaneous sharers and over 1.5†million downloads in eight hours. For the sixth season, HBO did not send screeners to the press, so as to prevent the spread of unlicensed copies and possible spoilers.
",NON-SPOILER
"Observers, including series director David Petrarca and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, said that illegal downloads did not hurt the series' prospects; it benefited from ""buzz"" and social commentary, and the high piracy rate did not significantly translate to lost subscriptions. According to Polygon, HBO's relaxed attitude towards piracy and the sharing of login credentials amounted to a premium-television ""free-to-play"" model. At a 2015 Oxford Union debate, series co-creator David Benioff said that he was just glad that people watched the series; illegally downloaded episodes sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy, especially in countries where Game of Thrones was not televised. Co-creator D. B. Weiss had mixed feelings, saying that the series was expensive to produce and ""if it doesn't make the money back, then it ceases to exist"". However, he was pleased that so many people ""enjoy the show so much they can't wait to get their hands on it."" In 2015, Guinness World Records called Game of Thrones the most pirated television program.

"Beginning on January 23, 2015, the last two episodes of season four were shown in 205 IMAX theaters across the United States; Game of Thrones is the first TV series shown in this format. The show earned $686,000 at the box office on its opening day and $1.5 million during its opening weekend; the week-long release grossed $1,896,092.

"Game of Thrones was highly anticipated by fans before its premiere, and has become a critical and commercial success. According to The Guardian, by 2014 it was ""the biggest drama"" and ""the most talked about show"" on television.
",NON-SPOILER
"Although Game of Thrones was dismissed by some critics before it began, its success has been credited with an increase in the popularity of the fantasy genre. On the eve of the second season's premiere, according to CNN, ""after this weekend, you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy"" and cited Ian Bogost as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with Peter Jackson's 2001 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and the Harry Potter films establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are ""gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture"". Its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.
",NON-SPOILER
"The series' popularity increased sales of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels (republished in tie-in editions), which remained at the top of bestseller lists for months. According to The Daily Beast, Game of Thrones was a favorite of sitcom writers and the series has been referred to in other TV series. With other fantasy series, it has been cited as a reason for an increase in the purchase (and abandonment) of huskies and other wolf-like dogs.
",NON-SPOILER
"Game of Thrones has added to the popular vocabulary. The first season's scene in which Petyr Baelish explains his motives (or background) while prostitutes had sex in the background gave rise to the word ""sexposition"" for providing exposition with sex and nudity. ""Dothraki"", the series' nomadic horsemen, was ranked fourth in a September 2012 Global Language Monitor list of words from television most used on the Internet. In 2012, the media used ""Game of Thrones"" as a figure of speech or comparison for situations of intense conflict and deceit, such as U.S. healthcare politics, the Syrian Civil War and the ousting of Bo Xilai from the Chinese government.
",NON-SPOILER
"""Khaleesi"" became more popular as a name for baby girls in the United States. In the novels and the TV series, ""khaleesi"" is not a name, but the title of the wife of a khal (warlord) in the Dothraki language, held by Daenerys Targaryen.
",NON-SPOILER
"Game of Thrones has received critical acclaim, although the series' frequent use of nudity and violence has been criticized. Its seasons have appeared on annual ""best of"" lists published by The Washington Post (2011), TIME (2011 and 2012) and The Hollywood Reporter (2012).
",NON-SPOILER
"The performances of the cast were praised. Peter Dinklage's ""charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware"" Tyrion, who earned him Emmy and Golden Globe awards, was particularly noted. ""In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage"", wrote Mary McNamara of the L.A. Times before Tyrion became the series' central figure in season two. Several critics highlighted performances by actresses and children. Fourteen-year-old Maisie Williams, noted in the first season for her debut as Arya Stark, was singled out for her season-two work with veteran actor Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister). Stephen Dillane has received positive reviews for his performance as Stannis Baratheon, especially in the fifth season, with one critic noting ""Whether you like Stannis or not, you have to admit that Stephen Dillane delivered a monumental performance this season.""

"First-season reviewers said the series had high production values, a fully realized world and compelling characters.[227] According to Variety, ""There may be no show more profitable to its network than 'Game of Thrones' is to HBO. Fully produced by the pay cabler and already a global phenomenon after only one season, the fantasy skein was a gamble that has paid off handsomely"". The second season was also well received. Entertainment Weekly praised its ""vivid, vital, and just plain fun"" storytelling and, according to the Hollywood Reporter, the series made a ""strong case for being one of TV's best series""; its seriousness made it the only drama comparable to Mad Men or Breaking Bad. The New York Times gave the series a mixed review, criticizing its number of characters, their lack of complexity and a meandering plot.

"The third season was extremely well received by critics, with Metacritic giving it a score of 91 out of 100 (indicating ""universal acclaim""). The fourth season was similarly praised; Metacritic gave it a score of 94 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, again indicating ""universal acclaim"". The fifth season was also well received by critics and has a score of 91 out of 100 (based on 29 reviews) on Metacritic. The sixth season has been praised by critics, though not as highly as its predecessors. It has a score of 73 on Metacritic (based on nine reviews), indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". The seventh season scored 77 out of 100 (based on twelve reviews) and was praised for its action sequences and focused central characters, but received criticism for its breakneck pace and plot developments that ""defied logic.""
",NON-SPOILER
"Despite its otherwise enthusiastic reception by critics, Game of Thrones has been criticized for the amount of female nudity, violence, and sexual violence (especially against women) it depicts, and for the manner in which it depicts these themes. The Atlantic called the series' ""tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, andóespeciallyósexual violence"" of the source material ""the defining weakness"" of the adaptation. George R. R. Martin responded that he feels obliged to be truthful about history and human nature, and that rape and sexual violence are common in war; and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels' themes, its historical realism. HBO said that they ""fully support the vision and artistry of Dan and David's exceptional work and we feel this work speaks for itself.""
",NON-SPOILER
"The amount of sex and nudity in the series, especially in scenes that are incidental to the plot, was the focus of much of the criticism aimed at the series in its first and second seasons. Stephen Dillane, who portrays Stannis Baratheon, likened the series' frequent explicit scenes to ""German porn from the 1970s"". Charlie Anders wrote in io9 that while the first season was replete with light-hearted ""sexposition"", the second season appeared to focus on distasteful, exploitative, and dehumanizing sex with little informational content. According to The Washington Post's Anna Holmes, the nude scenes appeared to be aimed mainly at titillating heterosexual men, right down to the Brazilian waxes sported by the women in the series' faux-medieval setting, which made these scenes alienating to other viewers. The Huffington Post's Maureen Ryan likewise noted that Game of Thrones mostly presented women naked, rather than men, and that the excess of ""random boobage"" undercut any aspirations the series might have to address the oppression of women in a feudal society. Saturday Night Live parodied this aspect of the adaptation in a sketch that portrayed the series as retaining a 13-year-old boy as a consultant whose main concern was showing as many breasts as possible.
",NON-SPOILER
"In the third season, which saw Theon Greyjoy lengthily tortured and eventually emasculated, the series was also criticized for its use of torture. New York magazine called the scene ""torture porn."" Madeleine Davies of Jezebel agreed, saying, ""it's not uncommon that Game of Thrones gets accused of being torture pornósenseless, objectifying violence combined with senseless, objectifying sexual imagery."" According to Davies, although the series' violence tended to serve a narrative purpose, Theon's torture in ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" was excessive.
",NON-SPOILER
"A scene in the fourth season's episode ""Breaker of Chains"", in which Jaime Lannister rapes his sister and lover Cersei, triggered a broad public discussion about the series' depiction of sexual violence against women. According to Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times, the scene caused outrage, in part because of comments by director Alex Graves that the scene became ""consensual by the end"". Itzkoff also wrote that critics fear that ""rape has become so pervasive in the drama that it is almost background noise: a routine and unshocking occurrence"". Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club wrote that the series' choice to portray this sexual act, and a similar one between Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo in the first seasonóboth described as consensual in the source novelsóas a rape appeared to be an act of ""exploitation for shock value"".
",SPOILER
"In the fifth season's episode ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"", Sansa Stark is raped by Ramsay Bolton. Most reviewers, including those from Vanity Fair, Salon, The Atlantic, and The Daily Beast, found the scene gratuitous and artistically unnecessary. For example, Joanna Robinson, writing for Vanity Fair, said that the scene ""undercuts all the agency that's been growing in Sansa since the end of last season."" In contrast, Sara Stewart of The New York Post wondered why viewers were not similarly upset about the many background and minor characters who'd undergone similar or worse treatment. In response to the scene, pop culture website The Mary Sue announced that it would cease coverage of the series because of the repeated use of rape as a plot device, and U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill said that she would no longer watch it.
",SPOILER
"As the sixth and seventh seasons saw Daenerys, Sansa, and Cersei assume ruling positions, Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post noted that the series could be seen as a ""long-arc revenge fantasy about what happens when women who have been brutalized and raped gain power""ónamely, that their past leaves them too broken to do anything but commit brutal acts in their own turn, and that their personal liberation does not effect the social change needed to protect others from suffering. TIME reported before the seventh season that ""Even if Benioff and Weiss donít always admit it, the show has changed. Scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back"".

"A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones have a broad, active international fan base. In 2012 Vulture.com ranked the series' fans as the most devoted in popular culture, more so than Lady Gaga's, Justin Bieber's, Harry Potter's or Star Wars'. Fans include political leaders such as former U.S. president Barack Obama, former British prime minister David Cameron, former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard and Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, who framed European politics in quotes from Martin's novels in a 2013 speech.

"BBC News said in 2013 that ""the passion and the extreme devotion of fans"" had created a phenomenon unlike anything related to other popular TV series, manifesting itself in fan fiction, Game of Thrones-themed burlesque routines and parents naming their children after series characters; writers quoted attributed this success to the rich detail, moral ambiguity, sexual explicitness and epic scale of the series and novels.

"In May 2017, after years of speculation about possible successor shows, HBO commissioned Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and a fifth unnamed writer to develop individual Game of Thrones successor series. All of the writers were to be working individually with George R. R. Martin, who also co-wrote two of the scripts. In September 2017, it was announced that Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman was developing the fifth prequel series. D. B. Weiss and David Benioff said that they would not be involved with any of the projects, and want to enjoy the successor series as fans. Martin said that all the concepts under discussion were prequels, though he believes the term ""successor show"" applies better to these projects, as they are not Game of Thrones spin-offs in the traditional sense. He ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea, and revealed that some may be set outside Westeros.

"Laws and Customs of the peoples living in the Seven Kingdoms are based on their feudal system of government.
",NON-SPOILER
"Lords have judicial power over cases that occur on their lands. A lord will hear petitions at his local castle-court, sit in judgment at trials, and pass sentence based on the evidence. In theory, justice derives from the authority of the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, who sits on the Iron Throne in the capital city of King's Landing. The King's power is delegated out to other great lords of the realm. This extends in a hierarchy from the king, to the rulers of the Great Houses (such as House Lannister), to major Houses (such as House Tarth), to minor Houses (such as House Cassel).[1]
",NON-SPOILER
"The King's Peace is supposed to extend over the whole realm, and though small scale feuds or succession wars happen now and again, the constant wars between the independent Seven Kingdoms were put to an end when they were unified in the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago. The King's peace also extends to protection from outlaws and pirates. The Targaryen Conquest specifically forced the ironborn to abandon their Old Way of preying on the commercial shipping of Westeros itself (though it is tacitly acknowledged that they instead raid the shipping and shores of other lands in Essos for plunder).
",NON-SPOILER
"The Seven Kingdoms do have a ìMaster of Lawsî, suggesting some sort of statutory written laws exist, but their legal system still appears to be primarily based on customary laws, prior precedent, and the wisdom of the lord presiding over a decision.
",NON-SPOILER
"Individual lords are supposed to enforce the laws and carry out punishment on their own lands. Only the major cities (and possibly a few of the large towns) have dedicated ìpolice forcesî, such as the City Watch of King's Landing.
",NON-SPOILER
"Gaining the title of knighthood does not make a man a lord, though many knights do eventually become lords. Knighthood is a middle-step between noble-born lords and commoners. A commoner can be knighted for valorous service in battle, but the title is not hereditary. A commoner who is knighted usually starts out as a ìhedge knightî, a poor freelance knight not bound in allegiance to a specific lord (considered to be so poor that they sleep under hedges by the roadside while searching for employment). The next step up for a prospective knight is to become a ìsworn swordî, sworn to the service of a particular lord. Beyond this step, a sworn sword may become a ìlanded knightî if his lord rewards him with land for his service, typically a smallholding, large farm or small manor with servants. Successful landed knights who expand their holdings or continue to perform exemplary service for their liege may be raised to the rank of ""Lord"" in time, leading a minor noble House. Sometimes a knight may skip some of these steps, and while rare it is not unheard of for a lord to reward a commoner for valorous service by granting him both land and the title of knighthood, as when Stannis Baratheon rewarded Davos Seaworth for his rescue of the garrison during the Siege of Storm's End.
",NON-SPOILER
"The difference between a ìlanded knightî and a ìminor lordî is often very subtle, as some landed knights may actually be wealthier and more powerful than minor lords whose families have fallen on hard times. However, the vital distinction is that only a ìlordî legally possesses the power of justice, which a landed knight does not. For example, House Clegane is a House of landed knights in service of House Lannister, but it is not a lordly House. Thus the head of the House, Gregor Clegane, does not possess the legal right to hear trials and pass judgement.
",NON-SPOILER
"The society and legal system of the Seven Kingdoms recognizes a hereditary noble class set above a class of commoners, who are officially known as ""smallfolk"" (the very name indicates their lower social standing). Members of the nobility are also known as ""highborn"", while commoners are known as ""lowborn"". Nobles officially possess more legal rights than the commoners do. Many crimes for which a lowborn peasant would be punished by having their hand cut off a noble will only be punished for by paying a fine. The noble-born also have the right to demand a trial by combat.
",NON-SPOILER
"There are a number of wealthy merchants in the few cities and towns, but on the whole, the Seven Kingdomsí society is feudal and agricultural. While there is a small merchant class, it does not extend far beyond the five major cities (Kingís Landing, Oldtown, Lannisport, Gulltown, and White Harbor). Even a wealthy merchant in Kingís Landing is still legally considered to be a ìcommonerî.
",NON-SPOILER
"Women, even noble-born women, do not have the same legal standing as men. Inheritance only falls on a woman if there are no males in her family ahead of her in line of succession. However, women can rule in their own right if they have no surviving brothers (and their brothers left no surviving heirs). An exception is Dorne, which allows equal inheritance. If the noble-born heir to a lordship is underaged (or otherwise infirm and unfit to carry out their duties), a regent may be appointed to rule in their name.
",NON-SPOILER
"Members of religious organizations are a different section of society, technically not nobles but possessing special privileges that commoners do not possess. This of course primarily applies to the clergy of the Faith of the Seven, the dominant religion in the Seven Kingdoms. The religion of the Old Gods of the Forest, which is the dominant religion in the North, has no organized clergy at all. In the Iron Islands, the Drowned Men who serve as the priests for their local religion devoted to the Drowned God are also held in high social esteem. In past centuries, the Faith of the Seven had the power to conduct its own trials in ecclesiastical courts. However, they lost the right to hold trials after the Targaryen Conquest, when such public powers were brought under the exclusive control of the king on the Iron Throne.

"Bastard children of a noble, who have been acknowledged by their noble parent, are allowed to take a special bastard surname which signifies their status and that they are of noble blood.[2] These bastard surnames are based on the region a child was born in, thus bastards from the North use the special surname ìSnowî (e.g. Jon Snow, Ramsay Snow), bastards from the Riverlands use the special surname ìRiversî, etc. Bastards are not allowed to inherit their parents'†lands and have no place in the line of succession (unless they are legitimized by special order of the king and allowed take their parents'†surname, which rarely happens). Even so, the acknowledged bastard children of a noble are still technically ìhighbornî, and enjoy legal rights which commoners do not possess. Unacknowledged bastards, of course, cannot confirm that they are indeed the bastard child of a noble, and thus are legally considered commoners (such as Gendry, who is secretly the unacknowledged bastard son of King Robert Baratheon). There is no outright law punishing noble men or women for having bastard children, instead it is considered a social and religious disgrace. This disgrace for having bastard children or being a bastard is not so great, however, in Dorne.
",NON-SPOILER
"The legal age of majority in the Seven Kingdoms is considered to be sixteen years of age (this may have been changed to eighteen years in the TV series). Their society does not possess a concept of ìadolescenceî as an intervening life-stage between childhood and adulthood. As soon as a boy reaches his sixteenth nameday, he suddenly becomes ìa man grownî, and is legally considered to be an adult. Legally, girls are also considered adults at sixteen, though culturally they are often seen as suddenly becoming ìa womanî as soon as they have menstruated. A girl who has had her first blood is often seen as now capable of being married.

"Inheritance practices usually follow primogeniture, a male-preference winner-take-all system.
",NON-SPOILER
"The local laws in Dorne are somewhat different from the rest of the realm, as it joined the realm not through conquest but through peaceful marriage-alliance only a century ago, and was thus allowed to retain several local customs. In particular, Dorne practices equal primogeniture, in which the eldest child inherits regardless of whether they are male or female.

"Marriage customs in the Seven Kingdoms vary considerably between the three major religions, and there are local variations in custom between different lands within the same regions.
",NON-SPOILER
"The best documented are the marriage customs of the Faith of the Seven, as it is the dominant religion on the continent. While the scale of the marriage can vary, it at least involves the couple exchanging marriage vows in a ceremony performed by a Septon, acting as a sacred witness. Large-scale marriages are typically performed in septs, before the gathered families of the bride and groom.

"Children born outside of marriage are bastards and cannot inherit lands or wealth from their parents. The Seven Kingdoms do have a system for acknowledging bastards with special region-based surnames (such as ""Snow"", ""Sand"", etc.), but they still cannot inherit.
",NON-SPOILER
"Marriages among the nobility of the Seven Kingdoms are rarely made for love, but as a means of securing political alliances between noble families. Arranged marriages to secure marriage alliances are very common. It is considered absurd for a member of the more powerful noble families to marry a commoner, throwing away any chance and a valuable marriage pact. Marriages into the royal family are seen as particularly valuable.
",NON-SPOILER
"It is considered unseemly for a girl to marry before she has ""flowered"", but a girl as young as thirteen or so is considered a ""woman"" after she has first had her blood, and thus capable of being married and having children. It is frowned upon for a girl to marry if she has not bled yet, but betrothals can still be established for young girls to be married when they are older.
",NON-SPOILER
"A marriage is only legally considered to be binding if it has been consummated, that is, if the bride and groom have had sex at least once. If a marriage has not been consummated, it may be annulled.
",NON-SPOILER
"The nobility in the Seven Kingdoms practice a custom known as a ""Bedding"", in which after the wedding feast is over, the bride and groom are physically carried off to the marriage bed, to ensure that the union is consummated. The men at the wedding carry off the bride, and the women carry off the groom. The group carrying each strips the clothing off the newlyweds while telling ribald jokes. Foreigners think this is a somewhat odd custom.
",NON-SPOILER
"Social customs are somewhat different in Dorne, which has more liberal attitudes towards sexuality. A holdover from the old court culture of their Rhoynar ancestorsí city-states on the eastern continent is that Dornish society still allows nobles to keep ""paramours"" - formal mistresses/unmarried lovers who can be male or female. Outsiders from the other kingdoms often dismissively think of Dornish paramours as little more than mistresses or prostitutes, but they often have significant social standing in Dorne. Some are even functionally treated as wives in all but name, such as Oberyn Martell's paramour Ellaria Sand.
",NON-SPOILER
"As a feudal society, the Seven Kingdoms do not maintain long-standing dedicated prisons. There are dungeons in the major cities and castles, but these are not meant for long-term confinement of a prison population: they are more along the lines of holding pens used until sentencing through corporal or capital punishment. Valuable military or political prisoners may be confined for an extended period, i.e. in the Black Cells under the Red Keep, but this is exceptional.
",NON-SPOILER
"Certain serious offenses such as rape are punishable by amputation (specifically castration), though in some cases even petty theft may be punishable by amputating a hand. Treason and oathbreaking are punishable by death. Those sentenced to execution or amputation, noble or commoner, have the option of joining the Night's Watch instead, as a form of exile (this has caused some to look down on the present-day Nightís Watch as a glorified penal colony). Only men can join the Nightís Watch, so women do not have this option (they usually join the monastic order of Silent Sisters instead). Once a man has sworn the oath to join the Nightís Watch, the oath is for life, and the penalty for desertion is death. Open refusal of a direct order is also considered treason and oathbreaking to the Night's Watch, and punishable by death. However, in certain situations, such as the ruling monarch's approval, it is possible for someone to actually leave the Night's Watch.

"In the south, professional executioners deal out death sentences, often by beheading or hanging. The royal executioner is known as the ìKing's Justiceî, though in a looser sense the term ""kingís justice"" refers to the laws enforced by the kingís authority throughout the realm (i.e. the executioner who acts as ìKingís Justiceî thus becomes the living embodiment of law and sentence).
",NON-SPOILER
"The North, however, still follows the practices of the First Men, which holds that the man who pronounces the sentence must swing the sword. The reasoning is that if a lord is not steadfast enough in his convictions to look a man he has sentenced in the eye and then kill him personally, there will be doubt that the condemned man was guilty. Moreover, the life-or-death struggle for survival that the Northmen have had to face in winters means that they take the weight of command very seriously. The Northmen feel that if a lord cannot look a condemned man in the face as he personally executes him, he is unworthy of the weight of responsibility and consequences of his own orders. Furthermore, the punishment is not only limited to beheading with a sword; for instance, following the Battle of the Bastards, Ramsay Bolton is executed for his crimes against House Stark, but Sansa Stark, as Ned Stark's eldest living trueborn child, does not personally behead him, but sets Ramsay's own hounds on him to devour him alive as she watches. Had Jon Snow, who is older than Sansa, also been trueborn, it would logically have fallen down to Jon to behead Ramsay personally (although Jon was later revealed to be Ned's nephew).

After the Targaryen Conquest, when the Boltons were still vassals under the rule of House Stark, flaying remained illegal.

The Great Houses also collect taxes from their vassal Houses.

"The crown also imposes various tariffs and fines on trade and shipping. Smugglers do try to sneak cargo past customs officials to avoid high shipping fees at ports, though the penalty if caught for smuggling is amputation. Davos Seaworth was once a notorious smuggler, yet was rewarded by Stannis Baratheon for his aid during the Siege of Stormís End. Stannis rewarded Davos with land and title, but still insisted on punishing him for his past smuggling crimes. However, while the penalty is often the amputation of an entire hand, Stannis commuted the sentence to simply cutting off Davosí fingertips on his non-dominant hand.

"Prostitution is tacitly legal in the Seven Kingdoms, in the sense that there is no official law preventing brothels from openly operating in the major cities and towns. Organized religion does discourage prostitution, and it is socially frowned upon, but it is nonetheless present, sometimes seen as an outlet for uncontrollable male sexual desires. Secular lords and kings have not (in general) tried to shut down prostitution, as taxing brothels is a good source of revenue.

"Slavery has been illegal in the Seven Kingdoms for thousands of years. Slavery is considered an abomination by both the Faith of the Seven and the worshippers of the Old Gods of the Forest. It was illegal in Westeros long before there even were Seven Kingdoms, and the unification of the Seven Kingdoms in the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago only served to strengthen the enforcement of this prohibition. Even selling criminals to foreign slavers from Essos is considered a heinous crime. When Jorah Mormont sold some poachers he caught on his lands to foreign slavers, he forfeited his lands and fled into exile.

"One of the major differences between the society of the Seven Kingdoms and the lands north of the Wall is that the Free Folk do not recognize a class of hereditary nobility within their culture. Instead, they choose their own leaders based on their ability, such as when a King-Beyond-the-Wall manages to unite the many wildling clans.

It would be difficult to discuss the ""Laws and Customs"" of the entire continent in one place (anymore than the Laws and Customs of ""Eurasia"" could be succinctly lumped together). Also, the narrative describes their societies in much less detail, so less is known about each of their distinct customs. Therefore, see the main articles on the Free Cities, Dothraki, Qarth, and Slaver's Bay for further information on the Laws and Customs of each region.

"In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, it is stated that many centuries ago, certain areas of the Seven Kingdoms had lords who practiced the right of ìFirst Nightî, to sleep with a commonerís wife on their wedding night. The practice was outlawed in many regions long ago, and was officially outlawed throughout the Seven Kingdoms two hundred years ago by King Jaehaerys I, grandson of Aegon the Conqueror. Nothing remotely like First Night ever existed in the real-life Middle Ages. It is an urban legend. The film Braveheart in particular popularized the belief that it was ever a real phenomenon, which was very controversial because historians had already rejected First Night as nothing but a myth fifty years before Braveheart was even made. Nonetheless, this became a major plot point in the books: Roose Bolton was known to claim the right of First Night even though it had been illegal for centuries; the product of one such rape was his bastard son and major character, Ramsay Snow.†
",NON-SPOILER
"In the real-life Middle Ages, prostitution was also usually not technically illegal. The rationalization that was usually given in such male-dominated societies was that it was a convenient outlet for male sexual desires, which were assuredly uncontrollable ñ the concept that men should simply try to restrain such impulses and their own behavior wasnít frequently considered. A general attitude of ""boys will be boys"" pervaded.

"At different times, real-life medieval countries had actual laws punishing homosexual acts and behavior. No specific mention has been made of anything like this in the books. Renly Baratheon and Loras Tyrell do hide their sexual relationship, though this could just be due to the religious condemnation they would face from the Faith of the Seven, not an actual secular law they would face punishment from. Dorne is quite tolerant and widely accepting of homosexuality and thus seems to have no outright ""laws"" punishing it, though Dorne was allowed to retain many of its own local laws when it entered the realm through a marriage alliance, such as equal primogeniture. Thus, the ""legal status"" of homosexuality in Dorne is not indicative of its legal status in the other kingdoms.

"Among the wildlings, who do not have established laws but loose customs, a man and woman are considered to be ""married"" if a man successfully ""steals"" a woman away while risking severe injury or even death by the woman and her relatives. The woman is expected to fight back the whole way. As a rule, the wildlings do not kidnap married women. If the man is able to successfully defend himself from her assault, it shows that he is strong, brave and cunning, and this is what wildling women seek in men. If the man turns out to be an abusive husband, the wife can always slit his throat. Because Jon took Ygritte prisoner instead of killing her and later spares her life, Ygritte and Tormund point out to Jon that he and Ygritte could be considered technically married. This stuns Jon, who reveals this was not his intent and his capture of her/saving her life was not for sex.  From a strictly technical standpoint, they are considered officially married in wildling culture.

"In contrast to Westeros, the eastern continent of Essos (across the Narrow Sea) is home to a large number of religions. Unlike the Faith of the Seven, however, few of these religions are widespread across large geographical areas: The Free City of Braavos does have a very diverse, cosmopolitan religious makeup, but each of the Free Cities, as well as the cities of Slaver's Bay, may contain worshipers of numerous local religions not found anywhere else in the world. The one major exception is the faith of the Lord of Light, which is very widespread, from the Free Cities in the west to Asshai in the distant east. Indeed, in the southern Free Cities such as Volantis, Lys, and Myr, the Lord of Light is the majority religion, and it has at least a plurality in many other major cities across the continent. Still, unlike in Westeros where the Faith of the Seven is often the exclusive religion, in many cities in Essos where the Lord of Light is the majority religion, there are still substantial minorities that follow other religions.

"George R.R. Martin explained his views on religion in the storyverse of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels: there is no one ""true"" religion, and as in real life, it is unconfirmed if any of the deities in these religions really exist. This is closely tied to depictions of magic in the storyverse: In Martin's view, something qualifies as ""magic"" when it is a mysterious and not fully understood force: if it was fully understood and could be reliably/consistently practiced - like spells cast in a Dungeons & Dragons game - it would really just be ""technology"" called by another name. Magic is indeed real in Martin's world, but in recent millennia, few people have experienced it or still believe in it, and none can truly be said to totally understand it. Some groups interpret these magical forces through the framework of the religious beliefs they have constructed, but it is unclear if they are correct.

For all she really knows, it is the Stranger aspect of the Seven that is answering her prayers, or the Drowned God, or some other completely unknown force that no religion has ever accurately described. She and other magic users are dabbling in forces beyond human comprehension, and religions like the Lord of Light are a mental framework developed to attempt to explain them. It is possible that whatever ""magical"" forces exist in the world might not even be accurately described as ""religious"" in nature, save that people apply these meanings to them. Or that the Seven-faced God worshiped in Westeros might literally exist as an actual deity - the point is that really knows for sure.

A thousand years ago, the Rhoynar people fled Valyria's western expansion and eventually settled in†Dorne, where they intermingled with the local populations of†Andals and First Men to form their own unique culture. Most of the Rhoynar†abandoned their old religion and adopted the Faith of the Seven, but a small handful clung to their previous†river-based culture and religion.

Originally, the Rhoynar lived in†city-states located on the great Rhoyne River and its network of tributaries, in the area of the modern Free Cities.

While the Lord of Light†is the majority religion in the southern Free Cities of Volantis, Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh, other religions are practiced alongside it: A handful of artistocratic families in Volantis still follow the old Valyrian religion (though they are a minority); coins in Lys are adroned with the image of a native love goddess, which may or may not be the same figure as the Weeping Lady;†and in Tyrosh,†the Fountain of the Drunken God is dedicated to the eponymous deity, and the Temple of Trios honors the three-headed god of the same name.

There are also numerous islands and archipelagos, including the Stepstones, Summer Islands, and Ib.
",NON-SPOILER
"A major feature of the world the narrative is set in is that it experiences long seasons of varying length, usually lasting at least a couple of years each. Historically, the seasons have been known to last up to a decade in extreme cases, though these only happen once every century or so. The length of the seasons is completely unpredictable and varies randomly. There is some very loose correlation that a long summer is often followed by a long winter, but this is more of a trend than a rule. Conversely, seasons may be unpredictably short: the Year of the False Spring was so-named because an entire spring season occurred during it which lasted only two months. The maesters of the Citadel keep a close eye on the length of the days in order to try to predict how long the current season will last, but this is an inexact science at best. The continent of Westeros extends much farther north than the continents of Essos and Sothoryos, and so is much more adversely affected by long winters. Meanwhile, Essos and Sothoryos are closer to the equatorial regions, which are typically warmer.
",NON-SPOILER
"Even so, there are hints that the seasons may not always have been this way: characters still define ""a year"" as a twelve month period, not a full cycle of summer to winter. Months are the same as in real-life, roughly a thirty day period; the term ""moon-turn"" is commonly used for ""month"".
",NON-SPOILER
"There is a suggestion that the long seasons are not naturally occuring, but may have a magical origin, stemming from a near-mythical event called the Long Night eight thousand years ago, when it is said that the White Walkers used the cover of a winter that lasted a generation and a night that lasted for years to invade Westeros. They were defeated in the War for the Dawn, thrown back into the furthest north and prevented from returning by the raising of the Wall, but the seasons never recovered. Maesters are highly skeptical of this story, dismissing it as folklore, despite the inarguable presence of the Wall.
",NON-SPOILER
"The unpredictable and years-long seasons of the world Westeros is in are in some ways more akin to mini-Ice Ages and warming periods, such as happened in the real-life Earth, though never to this degree. The ""Medieval Warm Period"" was a period of rising average temperatures across the northern hemisphere from the years 950 to 1250, which was followed by the ""Little Ice Age"", an equally long period of falling average temperatures. The major difference is that these ""mini-Ice Ages"" occurred gradually over a period of two or three centuries on real-life Earth: Westeros, in contrast, can shift within a matter of years or months into a bitterly cold ""winter"" lasting a decade. There is still some variation in temperature across a normal ""calendar year"" in Westeros, so that what should be winter months in a normal 12 month year do tend to be slightly colder than the rest. Because the North is located at a higher latitude it experiences such variation to a greater degree, and is known to experience ""summer snows"" during years-long summer seasons (i.e. during what should be winter months in a normal 12 month seasonal cycle). Such ""summer snows"" in the North are mentioned by Pycelle in Season 1's ""Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things"".

"At the time the TV series opens, the world has been experiencing a summer that has lasted for nine years, which is unusually long, and the maesters fear that a similarly long (or even longer) winter will follow. According to Tyrion Lannister, Westeros has experienced nine winters during his lifetime, the last ending about nine years before the beginning of the TV series. Tyrion states that the winter during which he was born was the longest of these, lasting three years. Thus, for the past thirty years or so, each full summer-winter cycle has lasted on average about 5ñ6 years.[1] Autumn arrives the following year (in Season 2), bringing the ten-year long summer to a close.[2]
",NON-SPOILER
"The peoples of the world can survive years-long winters because they adapted to this climate pattern centuries ago. Lords set aside vast amounts of non-perishable food items for storage against the next winter. Some castles, like Winterfell of House Stark, have elaborate greenhouses which permit the growing of vegetables even in the harshest winters. In the North of Westeros, which is badly affected by cold winter weather, many notable strongholds are built in favorable areas, such as Winterfell which is built over hot springs, or the Dreadfort of House Bolton which is built on volcanic vents. Despite these precautions, famine and starvation is common during Northern winters, and is one of the reasons the North has a small population despite its vast size.
",NON-SPOILER
"Another climate feature of their planet is that because it is bigger than real-life Earth it has much larger stretches of open water across its oceans, and combined with the fact that the warm summer seasons can last for years at a time, massive super-hurricanes are generated in the warmer southern waters of the Summer Sea during their summer years. These large storms sweep north, and usually tend to slam into the Stormlands and Shipbreaker Bay (it's why these locations have such names in the first place). While the winds and rains can be dangerous, the water the storms dump when they make landfall has also turned the southern portions of the Stormlands around Cape Wrath into a lush temperate rainforest.  The storms pass over the Stepstones to reach the Stormlands, the island chain between Westeros and Essos at the southern end of the Narrow Sea, before curving west to hit the Stormlands. If they went a little farther to the west, however, the storms would make landfall in Dorne, and dump all of their rains there - but because they don't, Dorne remains a parched desert land.  On rare occasions one of these super-hurricanes will sweep even farther north, past Massey's Hook and into Blackwater Bay, where it will ravage islands like Dragonstone.  Daenerys Targaryen earned the nickname ""Daenerys Stormborn"", because she was born on Dragonstone while one of these super-hurricanes was making landfall on the island.

"As stated in the World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014), the Order of Maesters in Westeros, and other learned men across the world, have studied astronomy for centuries, and by observing the movements of stars across the night sky, have determined with relative certainty that their world is a round globe. Isolated tribes or simple farm peasants in Westeros who have no education, of course, might still colloquially believe that the world is flat, but they are mistaken.  Apparently, their better knowledge of astronomy is one of the reasons they consider one twelve month period to be ""a year"": this is how long it takes for the movement of the stars to reset (as their planet moves around its sun - though it hasn't been stated if they understand that it isn't the other way around, with the sun orbiting around the world).  
",NON-SPOILER
"The maesters also understand that theoretically, a ship should be able to circumnavigate the globe, by continuing to sail west from Westeros until they come around to Yi Ti on the other side, then continue going west until they return to Westeros. They also understand that a ship could sail north over the pole and reach Yi Ti on the other sideóprovided that there is no landmass or arctic ice in the way. However, as of yet no ship has ever successfully circumnavigated the globe. Ships that have sailed west of Westeros and returned report finding only a vast ocean, and other ships simply never returned. Even the far south of Sothoryos and eastern end of Essos are unknown to men in Westeros. There have been some attempts to navigate north over the pole, but all have ended in failure due to dangerous ice and other unknown dangers.

"Westeros and the other lands in the known world are apparently located in their planet's northern hemisphere: the climate gets colder to the north extending into polar regions, and warmer progressing south towards the equator (it would be the opposite if in the southern hemisphere). Martin has said that Essos isn't quite as badly affected by the years-long winter seasons because it is closer to the equator, but he has never identified exactly where the equator is ó or even if it is known. That is, it is unconfirmed if the equatorial line runs through Sothoryos and the Summer Isles, or, if the equatorial line is even farther away to the south, and is unknown even to explorers from the Summer Islands. Sothoryos has not been fully explored, but a handful of travelers' reports indicate that it is at least as long north to south as Essos is long west to east.
",NON-SPOILER
"Nonetheless, while their globe is bigger than real-life Earth, it is not so utterly vast that that everything from the Wall to the Summer Islands is in the same climate zone: there is noticeable variation from polar regions to tropical regions. For all we know, however, regions like the Summer Islands which we would consider to have ""tropical"" climates are actually located in their world's ""sub-tropics"", and the ""tropics"" around their equator are so hot that they are truly uninhabitable to humans. Another hint about their world's size is that constellations in the night sky are noticeably different between the Wall and southern latitudes such as Dorne and the Summer Islands, meaning that the curvature of the globe is noticeable across such a distance (if their world were 100 times the size of Earth, the angle of curvature would be so low that they wouldn't be able to see different constellations between these latitudes).
",NON-SPOILER
"Little is known of the ""solar system"" and astronomy of the world Westeros is set in, though in general, it appears to be roughly identical to real-life Earth. Astronomy is rarely mentioned and not very important to the narrative, but there has never been any indication that it is particularly different from real-life. The world in the fictional narrative has one sun. One moon orbits the world, going through lunar phases that make up a ""month"" (known as a ""moon-turn""), equal to a real-world month.
",NON-SPOILER
"The solar system that the world is set in is known to have seven other planets besides the world the story takes place on. The peoples of the world don't appear to realize that these are other worlds like their own, i.e. that people can stand on (it's not even clear if they understand that the Moon is another ""world"" people can stand on). Planets are termed ""wanderers"" as they move across the night sky relative to the stars, which are fixed (incidentally, in real life the word ""planet"" comes from the Ancient Greek word for ""wanderer""). On real-life Earth, ancient cultures (such as Classical Greece) only knew of five planets in the night sky, not seven. However, this does not necessarily mean that their solar system is different from our own, just that their rate of discovery is different. Uranus was only discovered in the seventeenth century, and Neptune in the nineteenth, using astronomical telescopes: even Galileo in the sixteenth century, using his simple telescope, was able to detect Neptune, though he mistook it for a star and thus is not credited with its discovery. However, the people of the world that Westeros is set in actually do possess simple telescopes, which are frequently used to aid astronomical observations of the night skies. The best telescopes, which they call ""far-eyes"", come from the master-lenscrafters of the Free City of Myr, and are thus referred to as ""Myrish-eyes"". Therefore, it is entirely possible that they discovered their equivalent of Uranus and Neptune already, because they possess a few technologies such as basic telescopes which real-life medieval Europe did not yet possess.
",NON-SPOILER
"It is unclear if the seven ""wanderers"" (planets) have formal names in the narrative . The only individual one identified was simply called the ""red wanderer""óapparently their analogue of Mars. In the Seven Kingdoms it is associated with the Smith from the Faith of the Seven, though the Free Folk call it ""the Thief""óbecause when the red wanderer appears in the constellation of the Moonmaid, they consider it a good time of year for a man to ritually ""steal"" a woman from another village to take as a bride.
",NON-SPOILER
"While there is no apparent physical difference between the astronomical bodies of the fantasy world and real-life, certain culture-specific aspects are different, specifically that cultures in Westeros developed different constellations than those in real-life. There is no indication that the stars are outright arranged differently. Rather, because the Ancient Greeks did not exist in their world, logically, figures from Greek mythology such as ""Orion"" were not used as shapes for constellations: they played ""connect-the-dots"" differently with the stars in the sky, using figures from their own mythology. For example, one constellation is known as the ""Crone's Lantern"", referencing the Crone from the Faith of the Seven. Another constellation referred to several times in the novels is the Ice Dragon.
",NON-SPOILER
"Their solar system also has minor astronomical bodies, such as comets and meteors. The Red Comet appeared in the sky near the beginning of the War of the Five Kings. Now and then small meteorites have been known to crash into the planet as well: Dawn, the ancestral sword of House Dayne, was forged from the metal recovered from a ""fallen star"" (House Dayne even uses a falling star in their heraldry as a result). Dawn has unusual properties: it is as strong and sharp as Valyrian steel (which is forged using spells and dragon-fire), but the metal of the blade is the color of pale white milk.
",NON-SPOILER
"Author George R.R. Martin has stated that his fictional universe is meant to be a completely alternate and separate world not linked to our own in any way, specifically in contrast with J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium or Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series. Tolkien stated that his fantasy stories were meant to have actually occurred in our world, during a lost historical era roughly six thousand years ago; Tolkien's authorial conceit was that he simply found and ""translated"" a copy of the saga, similar to how the Anglo-Saxon saga Beowulf was lost for centuries until it was rediscovered. Meanwhile, McCaffrey's Pern fantasy series is really set in the far future, with the twist being that it's actually a colony planet that regressed to medieval technology levels (and in which dragons do exist, but created by the original colonists through genetic engineering). Similarly, Terry Brooks' Sword of Shannara series or Pendelton Ward's Adventure Time are also set in what appear to be medieval fantasy settings, but actually take place in post-apocalyptic futures after technological human civilization has fallen, allowing magic to come back into the world. Martin, however, has adamantly denied that Westeros is set in either the past or future of real life Earth.
",NON-SPOILER
"The unnamed world on which Westeros is located experiences erratic and extremely long seasons, which usually last at least several years and have been known to last a decade. It is vaguely implied that this was not always so, as characters still refer to a ""year"" as a twelve month period, etc. Martin has stated that the ultimate cause of these long seasons is magical, and not technological (unlike the Pern series, which ultimately revealed scientific or technological explanations to seemingly magical phenomena in the story).
",NON-SPOILER
"Most of the storyline is centered in the continent of Westeros, thus the worldview given to the audience is only the narrow perspective of the medieval population living there. Their society has not explored and mapped out the entire world. Much of the eastern continent of Essos is known fairly well to them through trade contact, but even so, the edges of their maps are simply blank space waiting to be filled in. George R.R. Martin has stated that his medieval fantasy world is based on specifically medieval Europe, thus most of the continents and inhabitants are loosely analogous to Europe in the Middle Ages.
",NON-SPOILER
"The basic conceit of the setting is, ""what if the British Isles were the size of South America?"" to the point of being a continent unto themselves. Martin has stated that the continent of Westeros is specifically based on an over-sized British Isles, and that it is roughly the size of South America. The ""Seven Kingdoms"" of Westeros are loosely analogous to the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy, the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which they established in the British Isles after their invasion. The North is intended to be loosely analogous to Scotland. Just as the Anglo-Saxons invaded the Celtic inhabitants of Britain, the Andals invaded the First Men who lived in Westeros. Centuries later, the Andals were themselves conquered by the Targaryens, in a loose equivalent of the Norman Conquest. Essos is loosely based on Eurasia: it was once dominated by Valyria, their equivalent of the Roman Republic, which fell several hundred years ago. Valyria's surviving colonies went on to become the Free Cities, which share several features with medieval Italy or other medieval urban areas in Western Europe. The Dothraki from the central-eastern plains of Essos are loosely based on steppe nomads such as the Mongols (with some additional elements of Amerindian plains peoples). Qarth is somewhat like Constantinople or India, though Martin has said that racially the pale white Qartheen aren't based on any real life group. Yi Ti, even further east than Qarth, is analogous to Imperial China and the Far East. Sothoryos is analogous to Africa, but just as Western Europe did not possess much knowledge of Africa or East Asia in the Middle Ages, neither do people in Westeros. The audience shares the perspective of the characters, because of Martin's narration (shifting third-person limited) style, and thus we only know what they know. It's a thematic point that the lands north of the Wall are unexplored and poorly mapped, just as they would be to a Roman soldier standing on Hadrian's Wall looking north to the edge of the known world. Martin has stated that he therefore will never reveal an omniscient map of the entire world his stories take place in:
",NON-SPOILER
"Also, Martin has stressed that it should not be assumed that his fantasy world even has an equivalent to the Americas or Australia, just waiting to be discovered. They might simply not exist, or have no direct analogues.[5]
",NON-SPOILER
"If the analogous situation holds that Westeros is their word's equivalent to the British Isles, Yi Ti is the equivalent to China, and only the north coasts of Sothoryos have been explored, this would mean that only less than a fourth of the entire globe is known to men living in Westros (the northern half of their eastern hemisphere above their equator).
",NON-SPOILER
"Martin has also stated that the storyline in his books is partially (and loosely) inspired by the War of the Roses, the civil war that occurred in England in the late 1400s following its defeat in the Hundred Years' War. Just as the War of the Roses was fought between the Yorks and Lancasters, the conflict in Game of Thrones is between the Starks and Lannisters. The technology level in their society more or less matches Late Medieval Europe, i.e. right before the use of gunpowder and cannons revolutionized medieval warfare and brought it into the Early Modern era.
",NON-SPOILER
"In May 2017 a commenter on Martin's blog directly asked him what the name of the planet is that Westeros and the other continents are set onócomparing it to how Tolkien's ""Middle-earth"" is a continent, but their word for their planet overall is ""Arda""óthat is, what would an educated Maester in the citadel refer to their own planet/world as. Martin responded that they would probably just call it ""Earth""óthere is no more elaborate name (such as the fan nickname ""Planetos"").[6]
",NON-SPOILER
"In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the world is presented much as in the series, although information about it was revealed much more slowly. No map of Essos existed at all until the publication of A Storm of Swords in 2000, which featured a map of Slaver's Bay. A Dance with Dragons added a map of the Free Cities in 2011 (after Season 1 aired). No map of the world beyond Westeros was provided during Season 1 of the TV series, through the HBO Viewer's Guide or other official supplementary materials. The opening credits only briefly depicted Pentos and Vaes Dothrak in such a way as to make their surrounding geography vague.
",NON-SPOILER
"HBO then released a larger world map on their website in 2012 when Season 2 began airing, based an early draft map of these eastern lands that George R.R. Martin provided them. However, Martin subsequently changed his conception of much of the eastern part of the world (roughly from east of the Dothraki Sea and the Red Waste, including Qarth and all the Jade Sea) subsequent to HBO creating their own map. The new, canon-for-the-books world map first appeared in The Lands of Ice and Fire, published in late 2012.
",NON-SPOILER
"The Lands of Ice and Fire revealed that Vaes Dothrak is in the northeast corner of the Dothraki Sea, and Qarth is roughly straight south from it along the same line of longitude, though on the opposite side of Essos. East of both Vaes Dothrak and Qarth are the largest mountain chain in the known world, the massive Bone Mountains, which form a nearly impenetrable spine stretching from the southern coast to the northern coast of the continent. There are only a few passes between the Bone Mountains, forming a major barrier for west-east travel. Thus ""everything east of the Bone Mountains"" and ""everything east of the Dothraki Sea and Qarth"" are interchangeable phrases. Knowledge of lands east of this clearly defined dividing line is very limited, though the maesters of the Citadel do have a rough map of it. The lands around the Jade Sea are in contact with Qarth through regular sea trade routes, such as the great empire of Yi Ti. Asshai is located at the far eastern edge of the Jade Sea and is little visited, due to its ill repute.
",NON-SPOILER
"The major difference between the early-draft map that HBO has been using for the TV series since Season 2 and Martin's finalized map in The Lands of Ice and Fire is that the Jade Sea curves to the north in the early draft, but it curves sharply to the south in the final draft. Yi Ti is located on the northern coast of the Jade Sea, so the early draft map that HBO uses places it at a much more northerly latitude than in Martin's final draft version. This would substantially alter Yi Ti's climate, which is actually sub-tropical in the final draft map. In the final draft, the Hyrkoonian cities of Bayasabhad, Shamyriana, and Kayakayanaya are oasis-cities in vast rain-shadow desert on the eastern shoulders of the Bone Mountains. In contrast, the early-draft HBO map depicts them as port cities on the coast of the Jade Sea, west of Yi Ti.
",NON-SPOILER
"Ever since the break between Season 2 and Season 3, therefore, it has been unclear if the HBO world map would be updated to the Lands of Ice and Fire book-canon world map. As of the end of Season 5, it has not been updated.
",NON-SPOILER
"This has virtually no impact on the narrative within the TV series itself, because the Dothraki Sea and Qarth are the farthest east that the narrative has ever gone, and hardly anything east of those locations has even been mentioned in the TV series. Barely anything was known about them from the core novels themselves, just from subsequent sourcebooks such as The Lands of Ice and Fire or the World of Ice and Fire 2014 sourcebook.
",NON-SPOILER
"The official TV maps have also curiously left out the Summer Islands, Naath, and Sothoryos. These locations do clearly appear in the opening credits sequence, howeverófrom Seasons 3 to 4 onwardójust not in official HBO guide maps. Naath and Sothoryos appear where they do in the books and in accurate detailógiven that they first appeared in the ""Map of Slaver's Bay"" and its surrounding first released with the third novel in 2000. Prior to Seasons 1 and 2, the novels already gave the general indication that the Summer Islands are south of the Narrow Sea (southeast of Westeros and southwest of Essos), but west of Sothoryos. Because the TV series already had this information, the appearance of the Summer Islands in the Season 3-4 opening credits generally matches thisóbut an official map of the Summer Islands was not released until The Lands of Ice and Fire, so their brief appearance in the opening credits is often at the edge of the map, and more vaguely representational. This is not a ""change"", so much as the TV series has simply avoided using the official map detail of the Summer Islands from The Lands of Ice and Fire.
",NON-SPOILER
"The Lands of Ice and Fire also mentions the existence of another large landmass south of Asshai and east of Sothoryos, called ""Ulthos"". It is explicitly unclear to characters in the narrative if Ulthos is a separate, fourth continent, or simply a very large island or subsection of Essos or Sothoryos. Even Asshai is shrouded in legend to people in Westeros, and they have heard nothing of ""Ulthos"" other than the name in accounts about Asshai's geographyóemphasizing that there are blank corners of the map that have not yet been explored by people from Westeros.
",NON-SPOILER
"Even the world map appearing in The Lands of Ice and Fire, however, only depicts a map of ""the known world"" as it would be known to educated men in Westeros, such as the Maesters of the Citadel. Thus it is reasonably accurate for regions of the eastern continents which are well-known to Westeros through trade contact (the Free Cities, Valyria, Slaver's Bay, etc.) but in the extreme far east near distant Asshai, myths and legends cloud the facts, resulting in descriptions of cannibals, ""bloodless men"", and ""winged men"" on the map which should not be accepted by the reader as objectively true. As George R.R. Martin himself explains:
",NON-SPOILER
"Jonathan Roberts, the professional illustrator who drew the maps used in The Lands of Ice and Fire based on Martin's instructions, was asked about the discrepancy between the TV map (based on earlier drafts) and the now-canon world map for the books he drew, which are different east of the Dothraki and Qarth. Roberts offered his unofficial opinion that it isn't really an ""inconsistency"", because again, the world map he drew is intended to be a map written by educated people in Westeros, and their knowledge about semi-mythical lands of the very far east is simply inaccurate to begin with (such as real-life maps produced in Medieval Europe that got the geography of China completely wrong). Thus neither the map the TV series was using nor his map can really be said to be an ""accurate"" map of Yi Ti and the regions of the Farther East.[9]
",NON-SPOILER
"When the Game of Thrones prequel projects were announced, Game of Thrones Wiki asked Martin if the prequels can use this opportunity to update the world maps used in the TV series to match the updated Lands of Ice and Fire version, and he replied ""I would vote for that, certainly.""
